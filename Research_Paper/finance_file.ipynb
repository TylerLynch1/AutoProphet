Note: you may never get the backtesting to match your real trading exactly but you need to get as close as possible.

As you would be using actual closes to do your real trading you should be using this to also do your backtesting.

Standard deviation is the square root of the sum of the squared deviations from the mean.\\nIn other words, an average is a way to measure how much an observation deviates from a set of data (like say, 10,000 data points). A standard deviation measures how far an observation deviates (or is from its average) from the mean. The standard deviation is the square of the average deviation (1000-10).\\nHow do I find the mean and standard deviation? You can use a spreadsheet or calculator to do this.\\nThe mean is</td>\n",

       "      <td>Even though the article doesn't actually use the word \"discount\", I think the corresponding word you are looking for is \"premium\". The words are used quite frequently even outside of the context of negative rates. In general, bonds are issued with coupons close to the prevailing level of interest rates, i.e. their price is close to par (100 dollar price). Suppose yields go up the next day, then the price moves inversely to yields, and that bond will now trade at a \"discount to par\" (less than 100 dollar price). And vice versa, if yields went down, prices go up, and the bond is now at a \"premium to par\" (greater than 100 dollar price)</td>\n",
       "      <td>\\nA discount is a discount, an incentive or payment that is given to an entity for the services or goods it provides. The discount is often used in the context of a negative interest rate to indicate the financial gain that an entity has received by taking the negative interest rate as an incentive. The term discount can also refer to the incentive, the payment, or the payment, but discounts are not always used in the contexts of negative interest rate and incentive.\\nIf you are familiar with the financial industry, you will realize that discounts are used in different contexts. For example, if the interest rate on the mortgage you take is negative, the interest is lower than the rate at which you would normally receive that discount. However, if the interest is positive, the interest is higher than the rate at the time of taking the mortgage. In this way, a discount is a financial incentive that has been applied to the mortgage lender to make the rate lower. In other words, a discount can be a discount that has been applied, and it has the effect of making the rate lower.\\nDiscount</td>\n",
       "      <td>\\nDiscounts are a way of reducing the total cost of borrowing. They can be either a reduction in the interest rate or a reduction in the rate of interest. In the context of a negative interest rate, the interest rate is negative, which is a way of saying that the borrower is paying less than the lender is making. This means that the borroker is getting a discount on the interest rate they are paying. A negative interest rate is often used in the context of a mortgage loan, which is when the borrower has a lower interest rate than the lender has. This is a common practice in mortgage loans. However, if the borrower defaults on the mortgage, then the interest rate will be higher than the lender's interest rate.\\nIn the context of a positive interest rate, the borrower pays more than the lender does. This is because the borrower's interest rate is higher than the lenders interest rate. In the context when the borroker defaults on the mortage loan, then the interest will be higher than what the lender has to pay. This is a different type of interest.</td>\n",
       "      <td>\\nThe financial industry is currently facing a major challenge due to the negative interest rate policy of some countries. The aim of the policy is to reduce the money supply. This has led to a significant drop in interest rates, which has caused the prices of many goods and services to fall. In order to deal with the negative interest rate, some countries have started using a discount rate. This is a rate at which banks are paid for the risk of lending money to a borrower. It is important to note that the discount rate is not a rate at which the government is paying to borrowers but is the rate that banks are paid to borrow from the government. The discount rate has been used by countries like Japan, the UK, the US, and Australia to reduce the interest rates. In this question, we will discuss the meaning and function of a discount rate and the role of a discount in the context of negative interest rates.\\nThe term \"discount rate\" is used to describe the rate of interest charged by a bank on a loan.

       "      <td>\\nA negative interest rate, or a discount, is the price for holding a financial asset, such as a bond, in the context of a negative interest rate. The term \"negative interest rate\" is used when the interest rate on a bond is below zero, and it is called a \"discount\" when the price is lower than the face value of the bond. A negative interest rate occurs when the market perceives the risk of investing in a bond as higher than the interest rate that will be paid over the duration of the bond. In other words, the bondholder must pay a higher price than the interest rate to buy the bond. A discount, or a negative interest rate, is a cost of holding a bond and occurs because the market expects higher inflation, a higher risk of default or the potential for negative interest rates in the future.\\nA negative interest or discount rate is a cost of investing in bonds that occur because of higher market risks.

       "      <td>When we talk about compounding, we usually think about interest payments. If you have a deposit in a savings account that is earning compound interest, then each time an interest payment is made to your account, your deposit gets larger, and the amount of your next interest payment is larger than the last. There are compound interest formulas that you can use to calculate your future earnings using the interest rate and the compounding interval.  However, your mutual fund is not earning interest, so you have to think of it differently. When you own a stock (and your mutual fund is simply a collection of stocks), the value of the stock (hopefully) grows. Let's say, for example, that you have $1000 invested, and the value goes up 10% the first year. The total value of your investment has increased by $100, and your total investment is worth $1100. If it grows by another 10% the following year, your investment is then $1210, having gained $110.  In this way, your investment grows in a similar way to compound interest. As your investment pays off, it causes the value of the investment to grow, allowing for even higher earnings in the future. So in that sense, it is compounding. However, because it is not earning a fixed, predictable amount of interest as a savings account would, you can't use the compound interest formula to calculate precisely how much you will have in the future, as there is no fixed compounding interval.  If you want to use the formula to estimate how much you might have in the future, you have to make an assumption on the growth of your investment, and that growth assumption will have a time period associated with it. For example, you might assume a growth rate of 10% per year. Or you might assume a growth rate of 1% per month. This is what you could use in a compound interest formula for your mutual fund investment.  By reinvesting your dividends and capital gains (and not taking them out in cash), you are maximizing your \"compounding\" by allowing those earnings to cause your investment to grow.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Under US law, a bank is not obligated to honor a check that is more than six months old. Â§ 4-404. BANK NOT OBLIGED TO PAY CHECK MORE THAN SIX MONTHS OLD. A bank is under no obligation to a customer having a checking account to pay a check, other than a certified check, which is presented more than six months after its date, but it may charge its customer's account for a payment made thereafter in good faith. Note the law says the bank is not OBLIGATED to honor the check, but they are not forbidden from doing so. I don't have a survey on this, but I think most banks won't honor a check after more than 6 months to a year. I've had a few occasions where early in the year someone accidentally wrote the previous year on a check, like on January 10, 2017 they dated the check January 10, 2016, and the bank has given me a hard time about cashing it. The statute of limitations to challenge payment or non-payment of a check is 6 years: Â§ 3-118. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. (b) Except as provided in subsection (d) or (e), if demand for payment is made to the maker of a note payable on demand, an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the note must be commenced within six years after the demand.  I understand your frustration about being denied money that you presumably worked for and earned. But look at it from the other side. Suppose you wrote a check to someone, and years later they still had not cashed it. At some point you'd want to be able to clear this off your bank account. What if you want to close the account? What happens when you die? Would your heirs have to keep this account open for years ... decades ... centuries ... on the possibility that someday someone will cash this check? Realistically, there has to be SOME time limit. 6 months should be plenty of time for someone to make it to the bank with a check. If the company still exists then you could argue they have a MORAL obligation to pay you. If they have records that show that they did indeed give you this check and you never cashed it there'd be no question that you were trying to cheat them. But a moral obligation and a legal obligation are two different things. Legally, they paid you, and it's your problem that you failed to cash the check. You could talk to a lawyer, but if you live in the US, I think you are out of luck. (Of course other countries have different laws.)</td>\n",

In our world, these traits are often used to describe how people respond to challenges and risks.\\n\\nBravery is the ability to face and overcome fear, even in difficult situations. It is like a sturdy roof that protects us from the rain and storms of life. When we are brave, we take risks, try new things, and face our fears head-on. This allows us to grow and learn from our experiences.\\n\\nOn the other hand, fearfulness is the opposite of bravery. It is like being trapped in a cage, unable to move forward or explore new opportunities. When we are fearful, we avoid taking risks and often let our fears control our actions. This can limit our potential and prevent us from experiencing new things.\\n\\nTo better understand these concepts, let's relate them to the sentence you mentioned about making a pie crust.

Ultimately, a (for-profit) corporation's board is tasked with maximizing its shareholder's wealth; as such, it can buy back shares, pay dividends, sell the company, liquidate the company, or expand the company, at its discretion, so long as it can justify to its shareholders that it is still attempting to maximize the value of their holdings.  Companies in their growth phase often don't return any money and simply reinvest - but the long-term hope is to either return money in the form of dividends on profits, or the sale of the company.</td>\n",

If you invest it in a fund now, you may not be able to get at least 18k at the time you are forcing yourself to liquidate.

If Degiro shuts down, it will notify you about the fact at least one month in advance, and you will have enough time to order a transfer of your positions to a different broker. If Degiro shuts down unexpectedly, your assets will remain to be held at SPV, a separate legal entity which Degiro uses to hold the financial instruments belonging to the clients. Since SPV does nothing else but holding the assets, it is very unlikely that something bad will happen with it on its own. With some help from Degiro and/or the regulator (AFM) you should be able to transfer your assets from SPV to a different custodian and broker and thus regain control over them. If you have a non-Custody account, you have slightly higher chances of losing your assets, because Degiro can borrow your securities held at SPV. If both the client for whom Degiro borrowed a security and Degiro itself go bankrupt at the same time, the lent security will not be returned to SPV, there will arise a shortage, which will be proportionally distributed among the accounts of the clients holding this particular security. However, then the investor compensation scheme should kick in and help you recover up to 20000 EUR of your losses.</td>\n",

Q1. The sure shot way of knowing that your company is depositing tax with government is to view your tax credit report. This was set-up in 2004 and gives the details of all credits against your PAN and the tax deducted against your PAN. It shows if the tax was TDS and which employer paid it, or if this was a self assessment, or TCS, etc.  To view this report there are 2 options:  Register directly at http://www.tin-nsdl.com/panregistration.asp.  Follow the one time registration process and keep viewing the tax credits. Note it normally takes 2-3 months to reflect the data.  The other alternative is that quite a few leading banks [Citi, SBI, etc] provide a direct access to this report from their internet banking frontend, provided your PAN is associated to your account. Q2. The only details you need to submit are the Form 16. This would have all the details of when the tax was paid and the BSR number required for reconciling. Q3. TDS is the liability of the employer. However if this has not been deducted or too little was deducted based on incorrect/incomplete information give by you, then its your liability. For example if you change jobs in a year, the tax deducted is always less and you have to pay the difference. Q4. If its established that the company was at fault for not deducting the tax or deducting and not paying it to government on time, there are enough provisions to penalize the company including putting the top management team behind bars.</td>\n",

       "      <td>So, the price-earnings ratio is price over earnings, easy enough. But obviously earnings are not static. In the case of a growing company, the earnings will be higher in the future. There will be extra earnings, above and beyond what the stock has right now. You should consider the future earnings in your estimate of what the company is worth now. One snag: Those extra earnings are future money. Future-money is an interesting thing, it's actually worth less than present-money- because of things like inflation, but also opportunity cost.  So if you bought $100 in money that you'll have 20 years from now, you'd expect to pay less than $100. (The US government can sell you that money. It's called a Series EE Savings Bond and it would cost you $50. I think. Don't quote me on that, though, ask the Treasury.) So you can't compare future money with present-money directly, and you can't just add those dollars to the earnings . You need to compute a discount. That's what discounted cash-flow analysis is about: figuring out the future cash flow, and then discounting the future figuring out what it's worth now. The actual way you use the discount rate in your formula is a little scarier than simple division, though, because it involves discounting each year's earnings (in this case, someone has asserted a discount of 11% a year, and five years of earnings growth of 10%). Wikipedia gives us the formula for the value of the future cash flow:  essentially adding all the future cash flows together, and then discounting them by a (compounded) rate. Please forgive me for not filling this formula out; I'm here for theory, not math. :)</td>\n",

When a company's profits are increasing, then the shareholders can expect the company to continue to grow and increase in value. Growth can also be seen in terms of the increase in the number of shares of stock. The number of shares of a company will go up in proportion to the amount of money that the company is making.\\nP/E ratio measures the ratio between the price of a company's stock and its earnings per share. P/E ratio is used to determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. If the ratio is above 100, then the stock is overvaluated. If the ratio falls below 10, then the share price is undervalued.\\nGrowth is not the only factor that investors look at when buying stocks.

It tells you the price that you're paying for a company's share of earnings. The higher the P/E ratio, the more expensive the stock is likely to be.\\nThe P/B ratio is also important. It tells you how much a company is worth when it's bought out. If you buy a company, you'll have to pay more than the P/E because you'll have bought a company with no earnings. If you buy the company at a high P/B ratio, you're pay too much.\\nThe PEG ratio is also important, but it's not as important as the other two.

In general, stocks with higher P/E ratios are more likely to experience growth, while stocks with lower P/E ratios may be less likely to grow.\\nOne of the most important factors to consider when analyzing the P/E ratio of a stock is the company's growth potential. A company with a high growth potential is likely to have a high P/E ratio, as investors are willing to pay more for the stock because they believe the company will grow in the future.\\nAnother factor to consider is the industry in which the company operates. Some industries are inherently more volatile than others, which can lead to higher P/E ratio stocks. For example, the technology industry is often more volatile than the healthcare industry, which can lead investors to pay more for technology stocks with higher PEG ratios.\\nIt's also important to look at the company's financials, such as its earnings and cash flow, to determine whether the P/E is justified.

To get a better idea of how good your trading system is you should work out your expectancy per trade. This will tell you how much you should make on average for every trade you take. Expectancy not only considers your win rate but also you win size to loss size ratio. For example if you are getting winning trades 80% of the time but your average win size is $100, and your 20% of losses average $500, then you will still be losing money. You should be aiming for an average win size of at least 2.5 to 3 times you average loss size. This will provide you a profitable trading system even if your win rate is 50%. If your trading system is really that good and provides a win size of at least 2.5 times your loss size then you should be actively trading it.

       "      <td>First of all, congratulations on being in an incredible financial position.  you have done well. So let's look at the investment side first.   If you put 400,000 in a decent index fund at an average 8% growth, and add 75,000 every year, in 10 years you'll have about $1.95 Million, $800k of which is capital gain (more or less due to market risk, of course) - or $560k after 30% tax.  If you instead put it in the whole life policy at 1.7% you'll have about $1.3 Million, $133k of which is tax-free capital gain. So the insurance is costing you $430K in opportunity cost, since you could have done something different with the money for more return.   The fund you mentioned (Vanguard Wellington) has a 10-year annualized growth of 7.13%.  At that growth rate, the opportunity cost is $350k.  Even with a portfolio with a more conservative 5% growth rate, the opportunity cost is $178k Now the life insurance.  Life insurance is a highly personal product, but I ran a quick quote for a 65-year old male in good health and got a premium of $11,000 per year for a $2M 10-year term policy.  So the same amount of term life insurance costs only $110,000.  Much less than the $430k in opportunity cost that the whole life would cost you. In addition, you have a mortgage that's costing you about $28K per year now (3.5% of 800,000). Why would you \"invest\" in a 1.7% insurance policy when you are paying a \"low\" 3.5% mortgage? I would take as much cash as you are comfortable with and pay down the mortgage as much as possible, and get it paid off quickly. Then you don't need life insurance.  Then you can do whatever you want.  Retire early, invest and give like crazy, travel the world, whatever.

While some may advocate borrowing money to buy rental real estate all reasonable advisers advocate having sufficient reserves to cover emergencies.   Keep in mind that 33% of homes in the US do not have a mortgage and some investment experts advocate only buying rentals with cash. Currently owning rental property is a really good deal for the owners for a variety of reasons.  Markets are cyclical and I bet things will not be as attractive in 10 years or so.

If the tax basis is based solely on the number of shares granted, it may not accurately reflect the tax impact of the RSU, especially if the shares are later sold or traded.

       "      <td>The answer is that tax is based on the business's revenue and profits, and RSU tax is a fixed rate of 10% that is added to the business's revenue for each share. The tax is also based on the amount of remaining shares after each share is sold, which is calculated as the difference between the business's revenue divided by the number of shares sold. The business's revenue remains constant, so the tax is always paid with the same amount of shares sold.\\nTo summarize, RSU tax is based on revenue, profit, and shares remaining after shares are withed, and the tax rate is fixed at 10%.

       "      <td>There are too many nuances to the question asked to explore fully but here are a few points to keep in mind. If you are a cash-basis taxpayer (most individuals are), then you are not required to pay taxes on the money that has been billed but not received as yet.  If you operate on an accrual basis, then the income accrues to you the day you perform the service and not on the day you bill the client. You can make four equal payments of estimated tax on the due dates, and if these (together with any income tax withholding from wage-paying jobs) are at least 90% of your tax liability for that year, then you owe no penalties for underpayment of tax regardless of how your income varied over the year. If your income does vary considerably over the year (even for people who only have wages but who invest in mutual funds, the income can  vary quite a bit since mutual funds typically declare dividends and capital gains in December), then you can pay different amounts in each quarterly installment of estimated tax. This is called the annualization method (a part of Form 2210 that is best avoided unless you really need to use it).  Your annualized income for the payment due on June 15 is 2.4 = 12/5 times your taxable income through May 31. Thus, on Form 2210, you are allowed to assume that your average monthly taxable income  through May 31 will continue for the rest of the year. You then compute the tax due on that annualized income and you are supposed to have paid at least 45% of that amount by June 15. Similarly for September 15 for which you look at income through August 31, you use a multiplier of 1.5 = 12/8 and need to pay 67.5% of the tax on the annualized income, and so on.  If you miscalculate these numbers and pay too little tax in any installment, then you owe penalties for that quarter.  Most people find that guesstimating the tax due for the entire year and paying it in equal installments is simpler than keeping track of nuances of the annualized method. Even simpler is to pay 100% of last year's tax in four equal installments (110% for high earners) and then no penalty is due at all.

In fact, there are many factors that affect your credit score, such as credit utilization ratio, late payments, credit inquiries, and the age of credit accounts.

       "      <td>In the past 10 years there have been mutual funds that would act as a single bucket of stocks and bonds. A good example is Fidelity's Four In One. The trade off was a management fee for the fund in exchange for having to manage the portfolio itself and pay separate commissions and fees. These days though it is very simple and pretty cheap to put together a basket of 5-6 ETFs that would represent a balanced portfolio. Whats even more interesting is that large online brokerage houses are starting to offer commission free trading of a number of ETFs, as long as they are not day traded and are held for a period similar to NTF mutual funds.  I think you could easily put together a basket of 5-6 ETFs to trade on Fidelity or TD Ameritrade commission free, and one that would represent a nice diversified portfolio. The main advantage is that you are not giving money to the fund manager but rather paying the minimal cost of investing in an index ETF. Overall this can save you an extra .5-1% annually on your portfolio, just in fees. Here are links to commission free ETF trading on Fidelity and TD Ameritrade.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The standard interpretation of \"can I afford to retire\" is \"can I live on just the income from my savings, never touching the principal.\" To estimate that, you need to make reasonable guesses about the return you expect, the rate of inflation, your real costs -- remember to allow for medical emergencies, major house repairs, and the like when determining you average needs, not to mention taxes if this isn't all tax-sheltered! -- and then build in a safety factor. You said liquid assets, and that's correct; you don't want to be forced into a reverse mortgage by anything short of a disaster. An old rule of thumb was that -- properly invested -- you could expect about 4% real return after subtracting inflation. That may or may not still be correct, but it makes an easy starting point. If we take your number of $50k/year (today's dollars) and assume you've included all the tax and contingency amounts, that means your nest egg needs to be 50k/.04, or $1,250,000. (I'm figuring I need at least $1.8M liquid assets to retire.) The $1.5M you gave would, under this set of assumptions, allow drawing up to $60k/year, which gives you some hope that your holdings would mot just maintain themselves but grow, giving you additional buffer against emergencies later. Having said that: some folks have suggested that, given what the market is currently doing, it might be wiser to assume smaller average returns. Or you may make different assumptions about inflation, or want a larger emergency buffer. That's all judgement calls, based on your best guesses about the economy in general and your investments in particular.  A good financial advisor (not a broker) will have access to better tools for exploring this, using techniques like monte-carlo simulation to try to estimate both best and worst cases, and can thus give you a somewhat more reliable answer than this rule-of-thumb approach. But that's still probabilities, not promises. Another way to test it: Find out how much an insurance company would want as the price of an open-ended inflation-adjusted $50k-a-year annuity. Making these estimates is their business; if they can't make a good guess, nobody can. Admittedly they're also factoring the odds of your dying early into the mix, but on the other hand they're also planning on making a profit from the deal, so their number might be a reasonable one for \"self-insuring\" too. Or might not. Or you might decide that it's worth buying an annuity for part or all of this, paying them to absorb the risk. In the end, \"ya pays yer money and takes yer cherce.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>Yes, this is possible with some companies. When you buy shares of stock through a stock broker, the shares are kept in \"street name.\"  That means that the shares are registered to the broker, not to you.  That makes it easy to sell the stock later.  The stock broker keeps track of who actually owns which shares.  The system works well, and there are legal protections in place to protect the investors' assets. You can request that your broker change the stock to your name and request a certificate from the company.  However, companies are no longer required to do this, and some won't.  Your broker will charge you a fee for this service. Alternatively, if you really only want one share for decoration, there are companies that specialize in selling shares of stock with certificates.  Two of them are giveashare.com and uniquestockgift.com, which offer one real share of stock with a stock certificate in certain popular companies.  (Note: I have no experience with either one.)  Some companies no longer issue new stock certificates; for those, these services sell you a replica stock certificate along with a real share of electronic stock.  (This is now the case for Disney and Apple.) With your stock certificate, you are an actual official stockholder, entitled to dividends and a vote at the shareholder meeting.

You cannot report it as a loss, and the IRS can't tax a transaction like that. If you really want to include these as sales as part of your LLC, you'll probably have to pay tax if you list it as income. I'm just confused as to why you'd want to do that, if you know that you're selling these particular items at a loss, and you also know that you have no documentation for them. I just wouldn't report anything you sold at a loss and treat it as \"garage sale items\" separate from your business.</td>\n",
       "      <td>?\\nIf the item is not sold on the day of purchase, the sale price is not deducted from the price.\\nWhat is the best way to calculate the price of a garage sale item?\\nThe best way to calculate a garage sale price is by calculating the gross sale price of the item and then subtracting the sales price from the gross sale price. The gross sale price is the price you pay the buyer for the item. If you pay less than the sales price, the seller will receive a larger amount of the sale price as a refund. If the item is a garage sale, you should subtract the gross sale price from the sale price to get the total sales price. The total sales price is the amount of money you paid for the item and it is your obligation to deduct the seller's gross sale price from it.\\nWhat are the different types of sale prices?\\nSale prices are different for each type of sale. For example, a sale price is calculated for a home sale if the seller is selling the home and the property is being sold to a third party.

       "      <td>Something to note is that when a company announces a share buyback program there is usually a time frame and amount of shares that are important details as it isn't like the company will make one big buy back of stock generally.  Rather it may take months or even years as noted in the Wikipedia article about share repurchases. Wikipedia covers some of the technical details here but to give a specific set of answers: When a company announces a share buyback program, who do they actually   buy back the shares from?  From the Wikipedia link: \"Under US corporate law there are five primary methods of stock repurchase: open market, private negotiations, repurchase 'put' rights, and two variants of self-tender repurchase: a fixed price tender offer and a Dutch auction.\" Thus, there are open market and a couple of other possibilities. Openly traded shares on a stock exchange?  Possibly, though there are other options. Is there a fixed price that   they buy back at? Sometimes.  I'd think a \"fixed price tender offer\" would imply a fixed price though the open market way may take various prices. If I own shares in that company, can I get them to buy back my shares? Selective Buy-Backs is noted in Wikipedia as: \"In broad terms, a selective buy-back is one in which identical offers are not made to every shareholder, for example, if offers are made to only some of the shareholders in the company. In the US, no special shareholder approval of a selective buy-back is required. In the UK, the scheme must first be approved by all shareholders, or by a special resolution (requiring a 75% majority) of the members in which no vote is cast by selling shareholders or their associates. Selling shareholders may not vote in favor of a special resolution to approve a selective buy-back. The notice to shareholders convening the meeting to vote on a selective buy-back must include a statement setting out all material information that is relevant to the proposal, although it is not necessary for the company to provide information already disclosed to the shareholders, if that would be unreasonable.\" Thus it is possible, though how probable is another question. While not in the question, something to consider is how the buybacks can be done as a result of offsetting the dilution of employees who have stock options that may exercise them and spread the earnings over more shares, but this is more on understanding the employee stock option scenario that various big companies use when it comes to giving employees an incentive to help the stock price.</td>\n",

The answer is yes, one does have to keep stock to receive the dividend payment until the payment date.\\n\\nDividend payments are usually made quarterly, but the frequency may vary depending on the specific stock and company. When a company pays dividends, it does so by distributing a portion of its earnings to its shareholders in the form of cash.\\n\\nTo ensure the smooth flow of dividend payments, it is often necessary to hold a certain amount of stock. This stock is known as stock position or holding. By holding stock, investors can benefit from the dividends even if they are not paid until a later date.\\n\\nStock position can be established by investing in the company's shares. By purchasing stock, investors become partial owners of the company and have the right to receive dividends and other financial benefits. Holding stock allows investors to benefit from the company's earnings over time, even if they are paid after the payment date.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce upon a time, there was a small town called Greenfield.

You can buy stock after taking a cash advance from your credit card. When you make a cash advance, you normally pay the credit card company a fee. When you make a regular purchase, the merchant (ie, the stockbroker) pays a fee. Additionally, credit card companies can make merchants wait up to 3 months to actually receive the money, in case the transaction is disputed. Your stockbroker is unlikely to want to pay the fee, accept the delay in receiving the funds, and risking that you will dispute the transaction. Having said that, many FOREX brokers will accept credit card deposits (treated as purchases), although FOREX can be considerably riskier than the stock market. Of course, if you max out your credit cards and lose all your money, you can normally negotiate to pay back the debt for less than the original amount, especially since it's unsecured debt.</td>\n",

       "      <td>?\\n\\nAnswer:\\n\\nDemat/Stock Market brokers do not support Credit Card Payments for a few reasons. First, Credit Cards have a higher interest rate compared to traditional payment methods like bank transfers or cash. This means that if a broker accepts Credit Card Payments, they will have to pay more in interest charges to their Credit Card Company, which can eat into their profits.\\n\\nSecond, Credit Cards do not provide the same level of security and protection as traditional payment methods. Credit Card companies have their own fraud prevention and dispute resolution processes, which can be expensive and time-consuming for brokers. Additionally, if a client makes a fraudulent transaction using their Credit Card, the broker could be held liable for the charges.\\n\\nLastly, Credit Card Payments can create additional administrative work for brokers. They would need to process credit card payments, reconcile them with their financial records, and ensure that the correct amount is deducted from the client's account. This can be time-consuming and can potentially lead to errors if not done accurately.\\n\\nOverall, while Credit Card Payments may be convenient for clients, Demat/Stock market brokers prefer to stick to traditional payment methods to avoid the potential risks and costs associated with Credit Cards.\\n</td>\n",

As a financial advisor, I can provide you with a detailed response to your question.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, it's important to understand that credit card companies are primarily concerned with the revenue generated from credit card transactions. When you pay your credit card bill, the credit card company typically receives a percentage of the total amount you owe. This revenue is then reinvested into the company, which may lead to higher interest rates and fees for you as the cardholder.\\n\\nCredit card companies often partner with banks or payment processors to offer services such as cashback rewards or other incentives. While these partnerships may seem beneficial to you as a cardholder, they are primarily aimed at maximizing the company's profits. Therefore, credit card companies may not fully support or encourage the idea of using credit cards for everyday expenses like paying for gas or groceries.\\n\\nMoreover, credit card companies have to comply with various regulations and guidelines to ensure the security and safety of your financial information. While they do take steps to protect your data, it's important for you to be aware that your credit card information is still vulnerable to fraud</td>\n",

The open price is the price at which the bar opened and the close price is the price which the bar closed. The height of the candle indicates the price movement of the bar. A bullish candle indicates an increase in the price, while a bearish candle indicates a decrease in the price. The wicks at the top and the bottom of the candle indicate the highest and lowest prices respectively, and therefore, the wick that is closest to the candle's closing price is the low price of the candle.\\nA bullish candlestick indicates an increase in price. For example, if the close price is $35.75 and the open price is $36.50, then the close price is higher than the open price. This is because the close price is equal to the high price.

       "      <td>\\nANSWER: One possible economic explanation for why greetings cards are so expensive is the law of demand and the law of supply. The law of demand states that as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. In the case of greeting cards, as the price of cards increases, consumers may choose to buy fewer cards or opt for cheaper alternatives, such as sending a text message or making a phone call. \\nThe law of supply states that as the cost of producing a good or service decreases, the quantity supplied increases, and vice versa, assuming that all other factors remain constant. In the case, greeting cards, the cost of producing them may be influenced by factors such as the cost of paper, ink, and labor, as well as the cost of advertising and distribution. If these costs increase, the price of cards may also increase, leading to a decrease in the quantity supplied and an increase in demand for cheaper alternatives.\\nAnother factor that may contribute to the high cost of greeting cards is the level of competition in the market. If there are many firms producing and selling greeting cards, they may engage in price competition, driving down prices to attract customers. However, if there are few firms</td>\n",

The topic of interest was the economics of greeting cards, which he says is a surprisingly profitable business. \\nThe question is this: why do they cost so much? Are they worth it? \\nThe answer may lie in the fact that they are a form of luxury good. They are expensive and people want to give them to people they care about, so they are willing to pay a higher price for them. However, they may not be as valuable as other luxury goods, such as cars or jewelry, because they are not as necessary or useful in everyday life. \\nIn any case, it is an interesting topic to think about, and one that is sure to provoke some interesting discussions. \\nA friend asked me what the best way to go about this question.

       "      <td>I don't know of a situation where rejecting a raise would make sense. Often, one can be in a phaseout of some benefit, so that even though you're in a certain tax bracket, the impact of the next $100 is greater than the bracket rate alone. Taxation of social security benefits is one such anomaly. It can be high, but never over 100%. Update - The Affordable Care Act contains such an anomaly - go to the Kaiser Foundation site, and see the benefit a family of three might receive. A credit for up to $4631 toward their health care insurance cost. But, increase the income to above $78120 Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and the benefit drops to zero. The fact that the next dollar of income will cost you $4631 in the lost credit is an example of a step-function in the tax code. I'd still not turn down the raise, but I'd ask that it be deposited to my 401(k). And when reconciling my taxes each April, I'd use an IRA in case I still went over a bit. Consider, it's April, and your MAGI is $80,120. Even if you don't have to cash to deposit to the IRA, you borrow it, from a 24% credit card if need be. Because the $2000 IRA will trigger not just $300 less Federal tax, but a $4631 health care credit.  Note - the above example will apply to a limited, specific group who are funding their own health care expense and paying above a certain percent of income. It's not a criticism of ACA, just a mathematical observation appropriate to this question. For those in this situation, a close look at their projected MAGI is in order.  Another example - the deduction for college tuition and fees.  This is another \"step function.\" Go a dollar over the threshold, $130K joint, and the deduction drops from $4000 to $2000. You can claim that a $2000 deduction is a difference of 'only' $500 in tax due, but the result is a quick spike in the marginal rate. For those right at this number, it would be worth it to increase their 401(k) deduction to get back under this limit.</td>\n",

The first is your current financial situation, including your income, expenses, and debt. If you have enough income to cover your monthly mortgage payments and other expenses, and if your debt-to-income ratio is manageable, then you may be a good candidate for a home purchase.\\nAnother factor to consider is your long-term financial goals. Do you plan to stay in the same area for several years, or are you planning to move soon? If you plan to stay for several years, then a home purchase may be a good investment. However, if you are planning to move soon, then it may not make sense to invest in a home.\\nFinally, you should consider the current state of the housing market and interest rates. If interest rates are low and the housing market is stable, then it may be a good time to purchase a home. However, if interest rates are high or the housing market is volatile, then it may make more sense to rent.\\nIn summary, buying a home is a major financial commitment, and it's important to carefully consider your current financial situation and long-term goals before making a decision.\\n</td>\n",

However, if you have some extra funds and are willing to take calculated risks, buying a house can be a good investment.\\n\\nIn terms of investing, both stocks and bonds have their advantages and disadvantages. Stocks offer the potential for higher returns but also come with greater risks. Bonds, on the other hand, provide more stability and are generally considered lower-risk investments.

This is what in the US is known as the Social Security.  This is a defined contribution plan, where the employee can chose the level of risk based on certain pre-defined investment guidelines (more conservative or more aggressive). In Poland, it appears that there's a certain amount of the state-mandated SS tax is transferred to these plans. Nothing in the US is like that, but you can see it as a mandatory IRA with a preset limited choice of mutual funds to invest into, as an analogy. The recent change was to reduce the portion of the madatory contribution that is diverted to this plan from 7+% to 2.3% (on account of expanding the contribution to (1)). Probably the recent crashes of the stock markets that affected these accounts lead to this decision. This is voluntary defined contribution plan, similar to the US 401Ks. This division is actually pretty common, not unique to Poland. I'd say its the \"standard\" pension scheme, as opposed to what we're used to in the US.</td>\n",

       "      <td>It depends on your investment profile but basically, dividends increase your taxable income. Anyone making an income will effectively get 'lower returns' on their investments due to this effect. If you had the choice between identical shares that either give a dividend or don't, you'll find that stock that pays a dividend has a lower price, and increases in value more slowly than stock that doesn't. (all other things being equal)  There's a whole bunch of economic theory behind this but in short, the current stock price is a measure of how much the company is worth combined with an estimation of how much it will be worth in the future (NPV of all future dividends is the basic model). When the company makes profit, it can keep those profits, and invest in new projects or distribute a portion of those profits to shareholders (aka dividends). Distributing the value to shareholders reduces the value of the company somewhat, but the shareholders get the money now. If the company doesn't give dividends, it has a higher value which will be reflected in a higher stock price.  So basically, all other things being equal (which they rarely are, but I digress) the price and growth difference reflects the fact that dividends are paying out now. (In other words, if you wanted non-dividend shares you could get them by buying dividend shares and re-investing the dividend as new shares every time there was a payout, and you could get dividend-share like properties by selling a percentage of non-dividend shares periodically). Dividend income is taxable as part of your income right away, however taxes on capital gains only happen when you sell the asset in question, and also has a lower tax rate. If you buy and hold Berkshire Hatheway, you will not have to pay taxes on the gains you get until you decide to sell the shares, and even then the tax rate will be lower. If you are investing for retirement, this is great, since your income from other sources will be lower, so you can afford to be taxed then. In many jurisdictions, income from capital gains is subject to a different tax rate than the rest of your income, for example in the US for most people with money to invest it's either 15% or 20%, which will be lower than normal income tax would be (since most people with money to invest would be making enough to be in a higher bracket). Say, for example, your income now is within the 25% bracket. Any dividend you get will be taxed at that rate, so let's say that the dividend is about 2% and the growth of the stock is about 4%. So, your effective growth rate after taxation is 5.5% -- you lose 0.5% from the 25% tax on the dividend. If, instead, you had stock with the same growth but no dividend it would grow at a rate of 6%. If you never withdrew the money, after 20 years, $1 in the dividend stock would be worth ~$2.92 (1.055^20), whereas $1 in the non-dividend stock would be worth ~$3.21 (1.06^20). You're talking about a difference of 30 cents per dollar invested, which doesn't seem huge but multiply it by 100,000 and you've got yourself enough money to renovate your house purely out of money that would have gone to the government instead. The advantage here is if you are saving up for retirement, when you retire you won't have much income so the tax on the gains (even ignoring the capital gains effect above) will definitely be less then when you were working, however if you had a dividend stock you would have been paying taxes on the dividend, at a higher rate, throughout the lifetime of the investment.  So, there you go, that's what Mohnish Pabrai is talking about. There are some caveats to this. If the amount you are investing isn't large, and you are in a lower tax bracket, and the stock pays out relatively low dividends you won't really feel the difference much, even though it's there. Also, dividend vs. no dividend is hardly the highest priority when deciding what company to invest in, and you'll practically never be able to find identical companies that differ only on dividend/no dividend, so if you find a great buy you may not have a choice in the matter.  Also, there has been a trend in recent years to also make capital gains tax progressive, so people who have a higher income will also pay more in capital gains, which negates part of the benefit of non-dividend stocks (but doesn't change the growth rate effects before the sale).  There are also some theoretical arguments that dividend-paying companies should have stronger shareholders (since the company has less capital, it has to 'play nice' to get money either from new shares or from banks, which leads to less risky behavior) but it's not so cut-and-dried in real life.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The relation between inflation and stock (or economic) performance is not well-understood.  Decades ago, economists thought inflation corresponded with periods of high growth and good real returns, but since then we have had periods of low inflation and high growth and high inflation with low growth.  It is generally understood among current economists that inflation levels (especially expected inflation) are neither indicative nor causative of real stock returns. Many things can affect inflation, and economic performance is only a minor one.  Many things can cause economic performance, and inflation is only a minor one.  It's not clear whether the overall relation between inflation and real stock returns is positive or negative. Notice, however, that in principle stock returns are real.  That is, the money companies make is in inflated dollars so profit and dividends for a company whose prospects have not changed should go up and down at the same rate as inflation. This would mean if inflation goes up by 5% and nothing else changes, you would expect stock prices to go up by the same proportion so you wouldn't have strong feelings about inflation one way or the other.  In real life stock prices will go up by either more or less than 5% but I'm not comfortable saying which, on average. Bottom line: current levels of inflation can't really be used to predict real stock returns, so you shouldn't let current inflation guide your decision about whether to buy stock.</td>\n",

Companies that have paid dividends for many years are more likely to continue paying dividends in the future.\\nDividends are an important part of any investment strategy. Investing in dividend-producing stocks is an excellent way to grow your wealth and protect against inflation and other economic downturns. By investing in dividend paying stocks, you can ensure that your wealth will continue to grow even during times of economic uncertainty. Investing</td>\n",

       "      <td>Most of stock trading occurs on what is called a secondary market. For example, Microsoft is traded on NASDAQ, which is a stock exchange. An analogy that can be made is that of selling a used car. When you sell a used car to a third person, the maker of your car is unaffected by this transaction and the same goes for stock trading. Still within the same analogy, when the car is first sold, money goes directly to the maker (actually more complicated than that but good enough for our purposes). In the case of stock trading, this is called an Initial Public Offering (IPO) / Seasoned Public Offering (SPO), for most purposes. What this means is that a drop of value on a secondary market does not directly affect earning potential. Let me add some nuance to this. Say this drop from 20$ to 10$ is permanent and this company needs to finance itself through equity (stock) in the future. It is likely that it would not be able to obtain as much financing in this matter and would either 1) have to rely more on debt and raise its cost of capital or 2) obtain less financing overall. This could potentially affect earnings through less cash available from financing. One last note: in any case, financing does not affect earnings except through cost of capital (i.e. interest paid) because it is neither revenue nor expense. Financing obtained from debt increases assets (cash) and liabilities (debt) and financing obtained from stock issuance increases assets (cash) and shareholder equity.</td>\n",

(See this article for the mexican case, the introduction has a list of other articles you could read on the subject). In some cases parity doesn't seem to be reached, which may have to do with transaction costs, the risk of transacting in a foreign market, as well as administrative &amp; legal concerns that can affect the direct holder of a foreign share but don't impact the ADR holder (since those risks and costs are borne by the institution, which presumably has a better idea of how to manage such risks and costs). It's also worth pointing out that there are almost always arbitrage opportunities that get snapped up quickly: the law of one price doesn't apply for very short time-frames, just that if you're not an expert in that particular domain of the market, it might as well be a law since you won't see the arbitrage opportunities fast enough. That is to say, there are always opportunities for arbitrage with ADRs but chances are YOU won't be able to take advantage of it (In the Mexican case, the price divergence seems to have an average half-life of ~3 days). Some price divergence might be expected: ADR holders shouldn't be expected to know as much about the foreign market as the typical foreign share holder, and that uncertainty may also cause some divergence. There does seem to be some opportunity for arbitrage doing what you suggest in markets where it is not legally possible to short shares, but that likely is the value added from being able to short a share that belongs to a market where you can't do that.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Disclaimer: it's hard to be definitive as there may be some law or tax rule I'm not aware of. From a UK perspective, this should be perfectly legal. If it's just a one-off or occasional thing for personal reasons, rather than being done in the course of a business, there probably aren't any tax implications. In theory if there's an identifiable profit from the transaction, e.g. because you originally obtained the INR at a lower exchange rate, then you might be liable to capital gains tax. However this is only payable above approximately Â£10K capital gains (see http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/cgt.htm) so unless this is a very large transaction or you have other gains in the tax year, you don't need to worry about that. I would only recommend doing this if you trust each other. If one side transfers the money and the other doesn't, the international nature will make it quite hard in practice to enforce the agreement legally, even though I think that in theory it should be possible. If the sums involved are large, you may find that the transaction is automatically reported to the authorities by your bank under money laundering regulations, or they may want documentation of the source of the funds/reason for the transaction. This doesn't automatically mean you'll have a problem, but the transaction may receive some scrutiny. I think that reporting typically kicks in when several thousand pounds are involved.</td>\n",

Private banks are regulated by government bodies and have strict guidelines to ensure the security and integrity of their transactions. Additionally, banks have the necessary infrastructure and technology to handle currency conversions accurately. Furthermore, the exchange rate offered by private banks is usually competitive and offers a better value for foreign residents compared to the banks' rates. Therefore, facilitating currency exchange between these accounts is a beneficial service for foreign residents. \\n\\n2. While I understand the benefits of facilitating currency exchange, I believe it is not a legal process. Private banks, unlike banks, are not subject to the same regulations and oversight by government bodies. This lack of regulation increases the risk of fraud and illegal activities. Moreover, private banks may not have the necessary resources and infrastructure to handle large volumes of currency conversions efficiently. As a result, there is a higher chance of errors and discrepancies in the exchange rates offered by private banks. Therefore, facilitating such currency exchange should be strictly regulated to protect the interests of foreign residents. \\n\\n\\n\\n(13).

I do not want to do this if I am required to pay taxes, but if I am not, then this is a great opportunity to increase my income. I will be using my home for the purpose of renting it out to people, not as a place where I live.\\nThanks for your help.\\nAirBnB has no tax implications if you rent your property out as a room. You must file a 1099 MISC, which is the form you would need to fill out to report rental income. You would have to file this as your own income and include the AirBnB fees as part of the income.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>The answer is in your question: derivatives are contracts so are enforced in the same way as any other contract.  If the counterparty refuses to pay immediately they will, in the first instance be billed by any intermediary (Prime Broker etc.) that facilitated the contract. If they still refuse to pay the contract may stipulate that a broker can \"net off\" any outstanding payments against it or pay out using deposited cash or posted margins. The contract will usually include the broker as an interested party and so they can, but don't need to, report a default (such that this is) to credit agencies (in some jurisdictions they are required to by law). Any parties to the trade and the courts may use a debt collection agency to collect payments or seize assets to cover payment. If there is no broker or the counterparty still has not paid the bill then the parties involved (the party to the trade and any intermediaries) can sue for breach of contract. If they win (which would be expected) the counterparty will be made to pay by the legal system including, but not limited to, seizure of assets, enforced bankruptcy, and prison terms for any contempts of court rulings. All of this holds for governments who refuse to pay derivatives losses (as Argentina did in the early 20th century) but in that case it may escalate as far as war. It has never done so for derivatives contracts as far as I know but other breaches of contract between countries have resulted in armed conflict. As well as the \"hard\" results of failing to pay there are soft implications including a guaranteed fall in credit ratings that will result in parties refusing to do business with the counterparty and a separate loss of reputation that will reduce business even further. Potential employees and funders will be unwilling to become involved with such a party and suppliers will be unwilling to supply on credit. The end result in almost every way would be bankruptcy and prison sentences for the party or their senior employees. Most jurisdictions allow for board members at companies in material breach of contract to be banned from running any company for a set period as well. edit: netting off cash flows netting off is a process whereby all of a party's cash flows, positive and negative, are used to pay each other off so that only the net change is reflected in account balances, for example: company 1 cash flows netting off the total outgoings are 3M + 500k = 3.5M and total incomings are 1.2M + 1.1M + 1.2M = 3.5M so the incoming cash flows can be used to pay the outgoing cash flows leaving a net payment into company1's account of 0.</td>\n",

Firstly, there are transaction costs involved in the transfer process. These costs vary depending on the bank and the destination country. In addition, there are currency exchange fees that need to be considered. These fees can significantly impact the overall cost of the transfer.\\n\\nAnother factor that affects the time it takes to transfer money is the availability of funds in the recipient's account. If the recipient's account is currently empty or has insufficient funds, the transfer may be declined. In such cases, the sender will have to wait until the recipient's account has sufficient funds to complete the transfer.\\n</td>\n",

In a sense, money printing is a way for poor countries to borrow money at a lower interest rate and therefore allow them to develop their economies and help their citizens. Money printing, however, does have its drawbacks.\\nI believe that poor countries should be able to use the money printing policy to their advantage. Money printing allows poor countries to borrow at a lower rate. For example, the United States is able to borrow money at an extremely low interest rate compared to many other countries. The United States is able borrow money at such a low interest rate because of the fact that the U.S. government is considered to be one of the world's biggest economies. The U.S. has a huge economy which is able to sustain itself through the printing of money. Money printing helps poor countries borrow money at a low rate.\\nI believe the U.S government has an interest in encouraging poor countries to borrow and print money.

       "      <td>A: Poor countries can print more money, but this can lead to inflation, which can further exacerbate the country's economic problems. Inflation occurs when there is an increase in the overall price level of goods and services in an economy. When a country prints more money, there is more money in circulation, which can lead to an increase in demand for goods and services. If the supply of goods and services does not increase to match this demand, prices will rise, and the value of the currency will decrease. This can make imports more expensive, leading to a further increase in prices, and can also reduce the purchasing power of the local currency.\\n\\nAdditionally, printing more money can lead to a loss of confidence in the country's currency. Investors may lose faith in the value of the local currency, which can lead them to withdraw their investments and move their money to other countries. This can lead to a further decline in the value of currency and can exacerbate economic problems.\\n\\nIn summary, while printing more money may provide short-term relief, it can lead to long-term economic problems such as inflation, loss of confidence in currency, and a decline in the value and purchasing power of the currency.

       "      <td>It's simply supply and demand.   First, demand: If you're an importer trying to buy from overseas, you'll need foreign currency, maybe Euros.  Or if you want to make a trip to Europe you'll need to buy Euros.  Or if you're a speculator and think the USD will fall  in value, you'll probably buy Euros. Unless there's someone willing to sell you Euros for dollars, you can't get any.  There are millions of people trying to exchange currency all over the world.  If more want to buy USD, than that demand will positively influence the price of the USD (as measured in Euros).  If more people want to buy Euros, well, vice versa. There are so many of these transactions globally, and the number of people and the nature of these transactions change so continuously, that the prices (exchange rates) for these currencies fluctuate continuously and smoothly. Demand is also impacted by what people want to buy and how much they want to buy it.  If people generally want to invest their savings in stocks instead of dollars, i.e., if lots of people are attempting to buy stocks (by exchanging their dollars for stock), then the demand for the dollar is lower and the demand for stocks is higher.  When the stock market crashes, you'll often see a spike in the exchange rate for the dollar, because people are trying to exchange stocks for dollars (this represents a lot of demand for dollars). Then there's \"Supply:\" It may seem like there are a fixed number of bills out there, or that supply only changes when Bernanke prints money, but there's actually a lot more to it than that.  If you're coming from Europe and want to buy some USD from the bank, well, how much USD does the bank \"have\" and what does it mean for them to have money?  The bank gets money from depositors, or from lenders.  If one person puts money in a deposit account, and then the bank borrows that money from the account and lends it to a home buyer in the form of a mortgage, the same dollar is being used by two people.  The home buyer might use that money to hire a carpenter, and the carpenter might put the dollar back into a bank account, and the same dollar might get lent out again.  In economics this is called the \"multiplier effect.\" The full supply of money being used ends up becoming harder to calculate with this kind of debt and re-lending.   Since money is something used and needed for conducting of transactions, the number of transactions being conducted (sometimes on credit) affects the \"supply\" of money. Demand and supply blur a bit when you consider people who hoard cash.  If I fear the stock market, I might keep all my money in dollars.  This takes cash away from companies who could invest it, takes the cash out of the pool of money being used for transactions, and leaves it waiting under my mattress.  You could think of my hoarding as a type of demand for currency, or you could think of it as a reduction in the supply of currency available to conduct transactions. The full picture can be a bit more complicated, if you look at every way currencies are used globally, with swaps and various exchange contracts and futures, but this gives the basic story of where prices come from, that they are not set by some price fixer but are driven by market forces.   The bank just facilitates transactions.  If the last price (exchange rate) is 1.2 Dollars per Euro, and the bank gets more requests to buy USD for Euros than Euros for USD, it adjusts the rate downwards until the buying pressure is even.  If the USD gets more expensive, at some point fewer people will want to buy it (or want to buy products from the US that cost USD).  The bank maintains a spread (like buy for 1.19 and sell for 1.21) so it can take a profit. You should think of currency like any other commodity, and consider purchases for currency as a form of barter.  The value of currency is merely a convention, but it works.  The currency is needed in transactions, so it maintains value in this global market of bartering goods/services and other currencies.  As supply and demand for this and other commodities/goods/services fluctuate, so does the quantity of any particular currency necessary to conduct any of these transactions. A official \"basket of goods\" and the price of those goods is used to determine consumer price indexes / inflation etc.  The official price of this particular basket of goods is not a fundamental driver of exchange rates on a day to day basis.</td>\n",

I get my salary every month. How many times I have to pay tax for Rs. 5,000 in one year?\\n(a) Rs. 300/-\\n(b) Rs.600/-\\nAnswer\\nAccording to the accrual method of taxation, an individual who earns money is liable to pay income tax in respect of the total income earned during the previous year. In this case, since the income for the year is only Rs. 600, it is not taxable for the year under consideration. The income for the year, for which a tax is payable, can be calculated by multiplying the number of months in the year by the annual salary. Thus, the total income earned by an individual for the year would be 600 x 12 = 7200 and the income tax would be Rs. 720.</td>\n",

       "      <td>What EU wanted to force Cyprus to do is to break the insurance contract the government has with the bank depositors. The parliament rightfully refused, and it didn't pass. In the EU, and Cyprus as part of it, all bank deposits are insured up to 100,000EUR by the government. This is similar to the US FDIC insurance. Thus, requiring the \"small\" (up to 100K) depositors to participate in the bank reorganization means that the government breaks its word to people, and effectively defaults. That is exactly what the Cyprus government wanted to avoid, the default, so I can't understand why the idea even came up. Depositors of more than 100k are not guaranteed against bank failures, and indeed - in Cyprus these depositors will get \"haircuts\". But before them, first come shareholders and bondholders who would be completely wiped out. Thus, first and foremost, those who failed (the bank owners) will be the first to pay the price. However, governments can default. This happened in many places, for example in Russia in the 90's, in Argentina in 2000's (and in fact numerous times during the last century), the US in the 1930's, and many other examples - you can see a list in Wikipedia. When government defaults on its debts, it will not pay some or all of them, and its currency may also be devaluated. For example, in Russia in 1998 the currency lost 70% of its value against the USD within months, and much of the cash at hands of the public became worthless overnight. In the US in 1933 the President issued an executive order forbidding private citizens keeping gold and silver bullions and coins, which resulted in dollar devaluation by about 30% and investors in precious metals losing large amounts of money. The executive order requiring surrender of the Treasury gold certificates is in fact the government's failure to pay on these obligations. While the US or Russia control their own currency, European countries don't and cannot devaluate the currency as they wish in order to ease their debts. Thus in Euro-zone the devaluation solutions taken by Russia and the US are not possible. Cyprus cannot devaluate its currency, and even if it could - its external debt would not likely to be denominated in it (actually, Russian debt isn't denominated in Rubles, that's why they forced restructuring of their own debt, but devaluating the currency helped raising the money from the citizens similarly to the US seizing the gold in 1930's). Thus, in case of Cyprus or other Euro-zone countries, direct taxes is the only way to raise money from the citizens. So if you're in a country that controls its own currency (such as the US, Russia, Argentina, etc) and especially if the debt is denominated in that currency (mainly the US) - you should be worried more of inflation than taxes. But if you're in the Euro-zone and your country is in troubles (which is almost any country in the zone) - you can expect taxes. How to avoid that? Deal with your elected officials and have them fix your economy, but know that you can't just \"erase\" the debt through inflation as the Americans can (and will), someone will have to pay.</td>\n",

These accounts allow your savings to grow tax-deferred or tax-free, depending on the type of account. Another way is to use tax-loss harvesting, which involves selling investments that have declined in value and using the losses to offset gains on other investments. This can help reduce your overall tax liability. Additionally, you can consider using tax-free savings accounts such as 529 plans or Roth IRAs to save for specific expenses, such as education or retirement.

If I own 1000 shares of the 1 billion, am I liable if the company goes under? No. Stocks don't work that way. If all I have is shares, not a short position, not options, I can only see my investment go to zero.  2 - Here, I'd ask that you edit your country in the tags. I can tell you that my newborn (who is soon turning 17) had a stock account in her name when she was a few months old. It's still a custodian account, meaning an adult has to manage it, and depending on the state within the US, the age that it's hers with no adult, is either 18 or 21. Your country may have similar regional rules.  Also - each country has accounts specifically geared toward retirement, with different favorable rules regarding taxation. In the US, we have accounts that can be funded at any age, so long as there's earned income. My daughter started one of these accounts when she started baby sitting at age 12. She will have more in her account by the time she graduates college than the average retiree does. It's good for her, and awful for the general population that this is the case.</td>\n",

I use such strong terms based on the fact that the website actually uses the distasteful pop-up ploy,  \"Are you SURE you want to leave this site?\" Clearly, something changed between what Weiss Ratings was in the past (per company history since 1971) and what Martin Weiss is doing now. Larry Edelson seems to have been associated exclusively with questionable websites and high pressure investment advice since 2007. From 1996 through the present, he worked as either an employee or contractor of Weiss Research. Let's answer each of your questions.  On June 22, 2006, the Commission instituted settled administrative   proceedings against Weiss Research, Inc., Martin Weiss, and Lawrence   Edelson (collectively, â€œRespondentsâ€) for violations of the Investment   Advisers Act of 1940 in connection with their operation of an   unregistered investment adviser and the production and distribution of   materially false and misleading marketing materials. Full details about Weiss Ratings operations, including its history from 1996 through 2001, when it operated in compliance with securities laws, then from 2001 through 2005, which was when the SEC filed charges for regulatory violations, are available from the June 2006 U.S. SEC court documents PDF.

Several banks went bankrupt and were liquidated, and the Argentine government had to intervene to prevent the collapse of the financial system. The government established the National Bank of Argentina (Banco Nacional de la República Argentina) to oversee the country's financial system and to provide liquidity to struggling banks.\\nThe closure of banks had a significant impact on the Argentinian economy.

       "      <td>The benefits and taxes thing, in my opinion is the biggie. Most people don't realize that the cost to the company for a full-time employee with benefits can be 2x or even 3x the amount they see in their paycheck.  Health plans are extremely expensive. Even if you are having money taken from your check for health insurance, it is often just a fraction of the total cost, and the employer is subsidizing the rest.  More expensive benefits that contractors don't typically get are 401K matches and paid vacation days. When contractors call in sick or don't work because it is a national holiday, they don't get paid for that day. Also, see that line on your paycheck deducting for Social security and Medicare? That is only half of the tax. The employer pays an equal amount that is not shown on that statement. Also, they pay taxes that go towards unemployment benefits , and may be required to pay higher taxes if they churn through a lot of full-time employees. You can usually let contractors go with relative impunity . For the unemployment tax reasons, not paying for people's days off or benefits, a lot less paperwork, and less risk to the business associated with committing to full-time employees all provide value to the company. Thus companies are willing to pay more because they are getting more.  Think of it like a cell phone-contract. If you commit to a three year contract it can be a pain/expensive to get out of the deal early, but you will probably get a better rate in exchange for the risk being shifted to your end of the deal.</td>\n",

       "      <td>NSCC illiquid charges are charges that apply to the trading of low-priced over-the counter (OTC) securities with low volumes. Open net buy quantity represents the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a 3-day settlement cycle. Open net buy quantity must be less than 5,000,000 shares per stock for your entire firm Basically, you can't hold a long position of more than 5 million shares in an illiquid OTC stock without facing a fee. You'll still be assessed this fee if you accumulate a long position of this size by breaking your purchase up into multiple transactions. Open net sell quantity represents the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a 3-day settlement cycle. Open net sell quantity must be less than 10% percent of the 20-day average volume If you attempt to sell a number of shares greater than 10% of the stock's average volume over the last 20 days, you'll also be assessed a fee. The first link I included above is just an example, but it makes the important point: you may still be assessed a fee for trading OTC stocks even if your account doesn't meet the criteria because these restrictions are applied at the level of the clearing firm, not the individual client.  This means that if other investors with your broker, or even at another broker that happens to use the same clearing firm, purchase more than 5 million shares in an individual OTC stock at the same time, all of your accounts may face fees, even though individually, you don't exceed the limits. Technically, these fees are assessed to the clearing firm, not the individual investor, but usually the clearing firm will pass the fees along to the broker (and possibly add other charges as well), and the broker will charge a fee to the individual account(s) that triggered the restriction. Also, remember that when buying OTC/pink sheet stocks, your ability to buy or sell is also contingent on finding someone else to buy from/sell to. If you purchase 10,000 shares one day and attempt to sell them sometime in the future, but there aren't enough buyers to buy all 10,000 from you, you might not be able to complete your order at the desired price, or even at all.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Conceptually, yes, you need to worry about it.  As a practical matter, it's less likely to be exercised until expiry or shortly prior. The way to think about paying a European option is: [Odds of paying out] = [odds that strike is in the money at expiry] Whereas the American option can be thought of as: [Odds of paying out] = [odds that strike price is in the money at expiry] + ( [odds that strike price is in the money prior to expiry] * [odds that other party will exercise early] ). This is just a heuristic, not a formal financial tool.  But the point is that you need to consider the odds that it will go into the money early, for how long (maybe over multiple periods), and how likely the counterparty is to exercise early. Important considerations for whether they will exercise early are the strategy of the other side (long, straddle, quick turnaround), the length of time the option is in the money early, and the anticipated future movement. A quick buck strategy might exercise immediately before the stock turns around.  But that could leave further gains on the table, so it's usually best to wait unless the expectation is that the stock will quickly reverse its movement.  This sort of counter-market strategy is generally unlikely from someone who bought the option at a certain strike, and is equivalent to betting against their original purchase of the option.  So most of these people will wait because they expect the possibility of a bigger payoff. A long strategy is usually in no hurry to exercise, and in fact they would prefer to wait until the end to hold the time value of the option (the choice to get out of the option, if it goes back to being unprofitable).  So it usually makes little sense for these people to exercise early.  The same goes for a straddle, if someone is buying an option for insurance or to economically exit a position. So you're really just concerned that people will exercise early and forgo the time value of the American option.  That may include people who really want to close a position, take their money, and move on.  In some cases, it may include people who have become overextended or need liquidity, so they close positions.  But for the most part, it's less likely to happen until the expiration approaches because it leaves potential value on the table.  The time value of an option dwindles at the end because the implicit option becomes less likely, especially if the option is fairly deep in the money (the implicit option is then fairly deep out of the money). So early exercise becomes more meaningful concern as the expiration approaches.  Otherwise, it's usually less worrisome but more than a nonzero proposition.</td>\n",

       "      <td>.\\nAnswer: When it comes to options, the probability of a stock being in the money versus expiring in themoney depends on several factors. One important factor is the time remaining until the expiration date of the option. If there is a long time until expiration, the stock is more likely to be in the money, as it has a higher chance of reaching the strike price. On the other hand, if the time until expiration is short, the stock is less likely to be in or out of the money.\\n\\nAnother factor to consider is the volatility of the underlying stock. Higher volatility generally increases the likelihood of the stock being in themoney. This is because higher volatility means there is a greater chance of the stock moving closer to the strike price.\\n\\nAdditionally, the strike price of the option also plays a role in determining whether the stock is in the money or expiring in theMoney. If the stock is trading at or near the strike price, it is more likely to stay in the money.

In the US, checks don't expire (there are countries where they do). Endorsements such as \"void after X days\" are meaningless and don't affect the obligation to pay. The bank is under no obligation to honor a check that is more than 6 months old (based on the date on the check, of course). This is from the Unified Commercial Code 4-404. However, this refers to the bank, not to the person who gave you the check. The bank may pay, if the check is deposited in good faith and there's nothing wrong with it or with the account. So the first thing you can do is deposit the check. If asked - you can say that the person just wrote the wrong date, which is true. Worst case the check bounces. If the check bounces - you can start with demand letters and small claim courts. The obligation to pay doesn't go away unless satisfied, i.e.: paid.   \n",

If a country defaults, and it leads to hyper-inflation, by definition that means that money loses its purchasing power.  In even simpler terms, it cannot buy as much tomorrow as I could today. Therefore people can be incented to either hoard physical goods, or other non-perishable items. Real-estate may well be such an item.  If you are resident in the country, you have to live somewhere.  It is possible that a landlord might try to raise rent beyond what your job is willing to pay.  Of course, in a house, you might have a similar situation with utilities like electricity... Assuming some kind of re-stabilization of the economy and currency, even with several more zeros on the end, it is conceivable that the house would subsequently sell for an appropriately inflation adjusted amount, as other in-demand physical goods may. Lots of variables. Good Luck.   \n",

Note: you may never get the backtesting to match your real trading exactly but you need to get as close as possible. The whole purpose of backtesting is to check if your trading strategies - your signals, entries and exits, and your stops - are profitable over various market conditions. As you would be using actual closes to do your real trading you should be using this to also do your backtesting. Rather than using adjusted data to get an idea of your total return from your backtesting, you can always add the value of the dividends and other corporate actions to the results from using the actual data. You may even find a way to add any dividends and other corporate action to your results automatically, i.e. any dividend amount added to your total return if the stock is held during the ex-dividend date. If you are using adjusted data in your backtesting this may affect any stops you have placed, i.e. it may cause your stop to be triggered earlier or later than in real trading. So you will need to determine how you will treat your stops in real trading.  Will you adjust them when there is corporate action such as dividends?  Or will you leave them constant until actual prices have gone up? If you will be leaving your stops constant then you should definitely be using actual data in your backtesting to better match your real trading.   \n",

So if you are spending time at your job, even if you are not billing anything to a client, you are earning your salary. If there are costs involved with these activities (maybe class fees, a book purchase, or travel expenses), the corporation should be paying the costs as business expenses.  However, the logistics of this, whether the corporation writes a business check to the vendor directly, or you put the expenses on a personal credit card and are reimbursed with an expense check from the corporation, don't matter.  Your accountant can show you the right way to do this.   \n",

The words are used quite frequently even outside of the context of negative rates. In general, bonds are issued with coupons close to the prevailing level of interest rates, i.e. their price is close to par (100 dollar price). Suppose yields go up the next day, then the price moves inversely to yields, and that bond will now trade at a \"discount to par\" (less than 100 dollar price). And vice versa, if yields went down, prices go up, and the bond is now at a \"premium to par\" (greater than 100 dollar price)   \n",

If you have a deposit in a savings account that is earning compound interest, then each time an interest payment is made to your account, your deposit gets larger, and the amount of your next interest payment is larger than the last. There are compound interest formulas that you can use to calculate your future earnings using the interest rate and the compounding interval.  However, your mutual fund is not earning interest, so you have to think of it differently. When you own a stock (and your mutual fund is simply a collection of stocks), the value of the stock (hopefully) grows. Let's say, for example, that you have $1000 invested, and the value goes up 10% the first year. The total value of your investment has increased by $100, and your total investment is worth $1100. If it grows by another 10% the following year, your investment is then $1210, having gained $110.  In this way, your investment grows in a similar way to compound interest. As your investment pays off, it causes the value of the investment to grow, allowing for even higher earnings in the future. So in that sense, it is compounding. However, because it is not earning a fixed, predictable amount of interest as a savings account would, you can't use the compound interest formula to calculate precisely how much you will have in the future, as there is no fixed compounding interval.  If you want to use the formula to estimate how much you might have in the future, you have to make an assumption on the growth of your investment, and that growth assumption will have a time period associated with it. For example, you might assume a growth rate of 10% per year. Or you might assume a growth rate of 1% per month. This is what you could use in a compound interest formula for your mutual fund investment.  By reinvesting your dividends and capital gains (and not taking them out in cash), you are maximizing your \"compounding\" by allowing those earnings to cause your investment to grow.   \n",

This is why the intra-day price fluctuates on a graph like a traded product.  Although VIXC can't be traded, it can still be used as an important signal for traders.

Â§ 4-404. BANK NOT OBLIGED TO PAY CHECK MORE THAN SIX MONTHS OLD. A bank is under no obligation to a customer having a checking account to pay a check, other than a certified check, which is presented more than six months after its date, but it may charge its customer's account for a payment made thereafter in good faith. Note the law says the bank is not OBLIGATED to honor the check, but they are not forbidden from doing so. I don't have a survey on this, but I think most banks won't honor a check after more than 6 months to a year. I've had a few occasions where early in the year someone accidentally wrote the previous year on a check, like on January 10, 2017 they dated the check January 10, 2016, and the bank has given me a hard time about cashing it. The statute of limitations to challenge payment or non-payment of a check is 6 years: Â§ 3-118. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. (b) Except as provided in subsection (d) or (e), if demand for payment is made to the maker of a note payable on demand, an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the note must be commenced within six years after the demand.  I understand your frustration about being denied money that you presumably worked for and earned. But look at it from the other side. Suppose you wrote a check to someone, and years later they still had not cashed it. At some point you'd want to be able to clear this off your bank account. What if you want to close the account? What happens when you die? Would your heirs have to keep this account open for years ... decades ... centuries ... on the possibility that someday someone will cash this check? Realistically, there has to be SOME time limit. 6 months should be plenty of time for someone to make it to the bank with a check. If the company still exists then you could argue they have a MORAL obligation to pay you. If they have records that show that they did indeed give you this check and you never cashed it there'd be no question that you were trying to cheat them. But a moral obligation and a legal obligation are two different things. Legally, they paid you, and it's your problem that you failed to cash the check. You could talk to a lawyer, but if you live in the US, I think you are out of luck. (Of course other countries have different laws.)   \n",

Shops are typically more generous, because they want to do business with you, but individuals are in a different position. In France, only official coins and bills are declared as Legal Tender (so if they don't want to, individuals don't even need to accept bank transfers). This is for doubts you need to pay. In addition, as you are not forced to do business with them, people and shops can require whatever they feel like to require - if you want to buy their car, they can ask you to stand on your head and spit coins, and if you don't like it, they don't sell to you. (They won't do much business then, probably)   \n",

PE ratio tells you the current share price divided by the prior 4 quarters earnings per share. It does not consider: Imagine someone walked up to you and said, \"Do you want to buy a piece of my business? I'll sell you 1% of it for $1000. Last year the business earned $25000.\" A quick calculation shows a PE of 4 [$1000/($25000 *.01)]. Even though this PE is comparatively low, you wouldn't buy in without a lot more info. What kinds of things might you ask? PE is one tiny component of an informed investment decision.   \n",

Activist investors frequently push for one or the other when a company is doing well - sometimes to the detriment of future growth, in some eyes - and can even file shareholder lawsuits (saying the company is not doing its duty to its shareholders by simply holding onto cash).  Apple famously held out from doing either for years under Steve Jobs, and only in the last few years started doing both - a large dividend and a share buy-back which increases the value of remaining shares (as EPS then goes up with fewer shares out there).  Carl Icahn for example is one of those investors in Apple's case [and in many cases!] who put significant pressure, particularly when they were sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars. Ultimately, a (for-profit) corporation's board is tasked with maximizing its shareholder's wealth; as such, it can buy back shares, pay dividends, sell the company, liquidate the company, or expand the company, at its discretion, so long as it can justify to its shareholders that it is still attempting to maximize the value of their holdings.  Companies in their growth phase often don't return any money and simply reinvest - but the long-term hope is to either return money in the form of dividends on profits, or the sale of the company.   \n",

What I would recommend is liquidate now, since it is a stock fund and stocks have performed very well this year, no need to be greedy and hope that they do as well in 2014. Since it is not an enormous amount of money, put it in an interest yielding savings account which unfortunately are all sub 1%. But the key here is since we cannot predict the markets, no investment is going to be \"safer\". You want the 18k to be there when you need it for the down payment. If you invest it in a fund now, you may not be able to get at least 18k at the time you are forcing yourself to liquidate. A good rule for investing is never to have to sell to make a purchase because there is a high probability that you will be selling at a sub-optimal price. Some savings accounts that have slightly higher yields. http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/01/pf/savings-account-yields/   \n",

If Degiro shuts down, it will notify you about the fact at least one month in advance, and you will have enough time to order a transfer of your positions to a different broker. If Degiro shuts down unexpectedly, your assets will remain to be held at SPV, a separate legal entity which Degiro uses to hold the financial instruments belonging to the clients. Since SPV does nothing else but holding the assets, it is very unlikely that something bad will happen with it on its own. With some help from Degiro and/or the regulator (AFM) you should be able to transfer your assets from SPV to a different custodian and broker and thus regain control over them. If you have a non-Custody account, you have slightly higher chances of losing your assets, because Degiro can borrow your securities held at SPV. If both the client for whom Degiro borrowed a security and Degiro itself go bankrupt at the same time, the lent security will not be returned to SPV, there will arise a shortage, which will be proportionally distributed among the accounts of the clients holding this particular security. However, then the investor compensation scheme should kick in and help you recover up to 20000 EUR of your losses.   \n",

Q1. The sure shot way of knowing that your company is depositing tax with government is to view your tax credit report. This was set-up in 2004 and gives the details of all credits against your PAN and the tax deducted against your PAN. It shows if the tax was TDS and which employer paid it, or if this was a self assessment, or TCS, etc.  To view this report there are 2 options:  Register directly at http://www.tin-nsdl.com/panregistration.asp.  Follow the one time registration process and keep viewing the tax credits. Note it normally takes 2-3 months to reflect the data.  The other alternative is that quite a few leading banks [Citi, SBI, etc] provide a direct access to this report from their internet banking frontend, provided your PAN is associated to your account. Q2. The only details you need to submit are the Form 16. This would have all the details of when the tax was paid and the BSR number required for reconciling. Q3. TDS is the liability of the employer. However if this has not been deducted or too little was deducted based on incorrect/incomplete information give by you, then its your liability. For example if you change jobs in a year, the tax deducted is always less and you have to pay the difference. Q4. If its established that the company was at fault for not deducting the tax or deducting and not paying it to government on time, there are enough provisions to penalize the company including putting the top management team behind bars.   \n",

But obviously earnings are not static. In the case of a growing company, the earnings will be higher in the future. There will be extra earnings, above and beyond what the stock has right now. You should consider the future earnings in your estimate of what the company is worth now. One snag: Those extra earnings are future money. Future-money is an interesting thing, it's actually worth less than present-money- because of things like inflation, but also opportunity cost.  So if you bought $100 in money that you'll have 20 years from now, you'd expect to pay less than $100. (The US government can sell you that money. It's called a Series EE Savings Bond and it would cost you $50. I think. Don't quote me on that, though, ask the Treasury.) So you can't compare future money with present-money directly, and you can't just add those dollars to the earnings . You need to compute a discount. That's what discounted cash-flow analysis is about: figuring out the future cash flow, and then discounting the future figuring out what it's worth now. The actual way you use the discount rate in your formula is a little scarier than simple division, though, because it involves discounting each year's earnings (in this case, someone has asserted a discount of 11% a year, and five years of earnings growth of 10%). Wikipedia gives us the formula for the value of the future cash flow:  essentially adding all the future cash flows together, and then discounting them by a (compounded) rate. Please forgive me for not filling this formula out; I'm here for theory, not math. :)   \n",

To get a better idea of how good your trading system is you should work out your expectancy per trade. This will tell you how much you should make on average for every trade you take. Expectancy not only considers your win rate but also you win size to loss size ratio. For example if you are getting winning trades 80% of the time but your average win size is $100, and your 20% of losses average $500, then you will still be losing money. You should be aiming for an average win size of at least 2.5 to 3 times you average loss size. This will provide you a profitable trading system even if your win rate is 50%. If your trading system is really that good and provides a win size of at least 2.5 times your loss size then you should be actively trading it. Also, if you put your trading system out there in the public domain together with your trading results you will actually find that, quite opposite to what the consensus above is, your results from your trading plan should actually improve further. The more people acting on the outcome of a signal in the same direction the higher the probability that the movement in the desired direction will actually occur. If you are looking to make money from your trading ideas, no one will pay anything unless you have real results to back it up. So if you are so confident about your system you should start trading it with real money. Of course you should start off small and build it up over time as your results eventuate as per your simulations.   \n",

So let's look at the investment side first.   If you put 400,000 in a decent index fund at an average 8% growth, and add 75,000 every year, in 10 years you'll have about $1.95 Million, $800k of which is capital gain (more or less due to market risk, of course) - or $560k after 30% tax.  If you instead put it in the whole life policy at 1.7% you'll have about $1.3 Million, $133k of which is tax-free capital gain. So the insurance is costing you $430K in opportunity cost, since you could have done something different with the money for more return.   The fund you mentioned (Vanguard Wellington) has a 10-year annualized growth of 7.13%.  At that growth rate, the opportunity cost is $350k.  Even with a portfolio with a more conservative 5% growth rate, the opportunity cost is $178k Now the life insurance.  Life insurance is a highly personal product, but I ran a quick quote for a 65-year old male in good health and got a premium of $11,000 per year for a $2M 10-year term policy.  So the same amount of term life insurance costs only $110,000.  Much less than the $430k in opportunity cost that the whole life would cost you. In addition, you have a mortgage that's costing you about $28K per year now (3.5% of 800,000). Why would you \"invest\" in a 1.7% insurance policy when you are paying a \"low\" 3.5% mortgage? I would take as much cash as you are comfortable with and pay down the mortgage as much as possible, and get it paid off quickly. Then you don't need life insurance.  Then you can do whatever you want.  Retire early, invest and give like crazy, travel the world, whatever.   I see no compelling reason to have life insurance at all, let alone life insurance wrapped in a bad investment vehicle.   \n",

It would be a great step to find landlords in your area and talk to them about lessons learned.  It might cost you a lunch or cup of coffee but it could be the best investment you make. rent it out for a small profit (hopefully make around 3 - 5k a year in profit) Given the median price of a home is ~220K, and you are investing 44K, you are looking to make between a 6 and 11% profit.  I would not classify this as small in the current interest rate environment. One aspect you are overlooking is risk.  What happens if a furnace breaks, or someone does not pay their rent?  While some may advocate borrowing money to buy rental real estate all reasonable advisers advocate having sufficient reserves to cover emergencies.   Keep in mind that 33% of homes in the US do not have a mortgage and some investment experts advocate only buying rentals with cash. Currently owning rental property is a really good deal for the owners for a variety of reasons.  Markets are cyclical and I bet things will not be as attractive in 10 years or so.   Keep in mind you are borrowing ~220K or whatever you intend to pay.  You are on the hook for that.  A bank may not lend you the money, and even if they do a couple of false steps could leave you in a deep hole.  That should at least give you pause. All that being said, I really like your gumption.  I like your desire and perhaps you should set a goal of owning your first rental property for 5 years from now.  In the mean time study and become educated in the business.  Perhaps get your real estate license.  Perhaps go to work for a property management company to learn the ins and outs of their business.  I would do this even if I had a better paying full time job.   \n",

Functionally, it's the same thing as if your employer did this: As such, the basis in that stock is $1,500 ($20*75). The other 25 shares aren't yours and weren't ever yours, so they aren't part of your basis (for net issuance; if they were sell to cover, then the end result would be pretty similar, but there'd be another transaction involved, but we won't go there).  To put it another way, suppose your employer paid you a $2000 bonus, leaving you with a $1500 check after tax withholding.

That's it.  The market maker ensures that there is a price at which you can buy and a price at which you can sell immediately, but these are not necessarily the best prices.  The majority of trades do not involve market makers and occur between two third parties. Whoever said a market order trades with the market maker is thinking of the way stock markets were years ago, not the way they are now. Market orders are supposed to execute immediately and at one time trading with the market makers was the method for executing immediately. If you issue a market order today, it executes with the best available limit order(s) on the other wide of the trade.  This may or may not involve a party that identifies as a market maker.   \n",

If you are a cash-basis taxpayer (most individuals are), then you are not required to pay taxes on the money that has been billed but not received as yet.  If you operate on an accrual basis, then the income accrues to you the day you perform the service and not on the day you bill the client. You can make four equal payments of estimated tax on the due dates, and if these (together with any income tax withholding from wage-paying jobs) are at least 90% of your tax liability for that year, then you owe no penalties for underpayment of tax regardless of how your income varied over the year. If your income does vary considerably over the year (even for people who only have wages but who invest in mutual funds, the income can  vary quite a bit since mutual funds typically declare dividends and capital gains in December), then you can pay different amounts in each quarterly installment of estimated tax. This is called the annualization method (a part of Form 2210 that is best avoided unless you really need to use it).  Your annualized income for the payment due on June 15 is 2.4 = 12/5 times your taxable income through May 31. Thus, on Form 2210, you are allowed to assume that your average monthly taxable income  through May 31 will continue for the rest of the year. You then compute the tax due on that annualized income and you are supposed to have paid at least 45% of that amount by June 15. Similarly for September 15 for which you look at income through August 31, you use a multiplier of 1.5 = 12/8 and need to pay 67.5% of the tax on the annualized income, and so on.  If you miscalculate these numbers and pay too little tax in any installment, then you owe penalties for that quarter.  Most people find that guesstimating the tax due for the entire year and paying it in equal installments is simpler than keeping track of nuances of the annualized method. Even simpler is to pay 100% of last year's tax in four equal installments (110% for high earners) and then no penalty is due at all. If your business is really taking off and your income is going to be substantially higher in one year, then this 100%/110% of last year's tax deal could allow you to postpone a significant chunk of your tax bill till April 15.   \n",

In the US, what counts is what shows on the bill. I've run $20K through a card with a $10K limit, but still ended the month under $2K by making extra payments. As long as you stay ahead of the limit by making mid-cycle payments, I see no issue with this strategy. If you keep running $30K/mo through a card with a $10K limit, the bank will eventually catch this and raise your limit as you will have proven you are more credit worthy.   \n",

A good example is Fidelity's Four In One. The trade off was a management fee for the fund in exchange for having to manage the portfolio itself and pay separate commissions and fees. These days though it is very simple and pretty cheap to put together a basket of 5-6 ETFs that would represent a balanced portfolio. Whats even more interesting is that large online brokerage houses are starting to offer commission free trading of a number of ETFs, as long as they are not day traded and are held for a period similar to NTF mutual funds.  I think you could easily put together a basket of 5-6 ETFs to trade on Fidelity or TD Ameritrade commission free, and one that would represent a nice diversified portfolio. The main advantage is that you are not giving money to the fund manager but rather paying the minimal cost of investing in an index ETF. Overall this can save you an extra .5-1% annually on your portfolio, just in fees. Here are links to commission free ETF trading on Fidelity and TD Ameritrade.   \n",

You said liquid assets, and that's correct; you don't want to be forced into a reverse mortgage by anything short of a disaster. An old rule of thumb was that -- properly invested -- you could expect about 4% real return after subtracting inflation. That may or may not still be correct, but it makes an easy starting point. If we take your number of $50k/year (today's dollars) and assume you've included all the tax and contingency amounts, that means your nest egg needs to be 50k/.04, or $1,250,000. (I'm figuring I need at least $1.8M liquid assets to retire.) The $1.5M you gave would, under this set of assumptions, allow drawing up to $60k/year, which gives you some hope that your holdings would mot just maintain themselves but grow, giving you additional buffer against emergencies later. Having said that: some folks have suggested that, given what the market is currently doing, it might be wiser to assume smaller average returns. Or you may make different assumptions about inflation, or want a larger emergency buffer. That's all judgement calls, based on your best guesses about the economy in general and your investments in particular.  A good financial advisor (not a broker) will have access to better tools for exploring this, using techniques like monte-carlo simulation to try to estimate both best and worst cases, and can thus give you a somewhat more reliable answer than this rule-of-thumb approach. But that's still probabilities, not promises. Another way to test it: Find out how much an insurance company would want as the price of an open-ended inflation-adjusted $50k-a-year annuity. Making these estimates is their business; if they can't make a good guess, nobody can. Admittedly they're also factoring the odds of your dying early into the mix, but on the other hand they're also planning on making a profit from the deal, so their number might be a reasonable one for \"self-insuring\" too. Or might not. Or you might decide that it's worth buying an annuity for part or all of this, paying them to absorb the risk. In the end, \"ya pays yer money and takes yer cherce.\"   \n",

If an \"unexpected world events\" occurs, the volume/liquidity will most certainly increase. Another example is the Forex Market that's open 24/7 around the world. As one major forex market closes, another one opens.

When you buy shares of stock through a stock broker, the shares are kept in \"street name.\"  That means that the shares are registered to the broker, not to you.  That makes it easy to sell the stock later.  The stock broker keeps track of who actually owns which shares.  The system works well, and there are legal protections in place to protect the investors' assets. You can request that your broker change the stock to your name and request a certificate from the company.  However, companies are no longer required to do this, and some won't.  Your broker will charge you a fee for this service. Alternatively, if you really only want one share for decoration, there are companies that specialize in selling shares of stock with certificates.  Two of them are giveashare.com and uniquestockgift.com, which offer one real share of stock with a stock certificate in certain popular companies.  (Note: I have no experience with either one.)  Some companies no longer issue new stock certificates; for those, these services sell you a replica stock certificate along with a real share of electronic stock.  (This is now the case for Disney and Apple.) With your stock certificate, you are an actual official stockholder, entitled to dividends and a vote at the shareholder meeting. If this is strictly an investment for you, consider the advantages of street name shares: As to your question on buying stock directly from a company and bypassing a broker altogether, see Can I buy stocks directly from a public company?   \n",

A few other things you might want to think about: Tax In some jurisdictions you can deduct mortgage interest against your income tax. I see from your profile that you're in Texas, but I don't know the exact situation there and I think it's better to keep this answer general anyway. If that's the case for you, then you should re-run your numbers taking that into account. You may also be able to make your investments tax-advantaged, for example if you save them in a retirement account. You'll need to apply the appropriate limits for your specific situation and take an educated guess as to how that might change over the next 30 years. Liquidity The money you're not spending on your mortgage is money that's available to you for other spending or emergencies - i.e. even though your default assumption is to invest it and that's a sensible way to compare with the mortgage, you might still place some extra value on having more free access to it. Overpayments Would you have the option to pay extra on the mortgage? That's another way of \"investing\" your money that gets you a guaranteed return of the mortgage rate. You might want to consider if you'd want to send some of your excess money that way.   \n",

You cannot report it as a loss, and the IRS can't tax a transaction like that. If you really want to include these as sales as part of your LLC, you'll probably have to pay tax if you list it as income. I'm just confused as to why you'd want to do that, if you know that you're selling these particular items at a loss, and you also know that you have no documentation for them. I just wouldn't report anything you sold at a loss and treat it as \"garage sale items\" separate from your business.   \n",

I believe its an established and well used process, and they would be \"classified\" as a \"normal\" mortgage. The process even has its own wiki page Incidentally I considered doing it myself. I looked into it briefly, but the cost of fee's seemed to outweigh the possible future benefits of lower interest rates and currency fluctuations.   \n",

Rather it may take months or even years as noted in the Wikipedia article about share repurchases. Wikipedia covers some of the technical details here but to give a specific set of answers: When a company announces a share buyback program, who do they actually   buy back the shares from?  From the Wikipedia link: \"Under US corporate law there are five primary methods of stock repurchase: open market, private negotiations, repurchase 'put' rights, and two variants of self-tender repurchase: a fixed price tender offer and a Dutch auction.\" Thus, there are open market and a couple of other possibilities. Openly traded shares on a stock exchange?  Possibly, though there are other options. Is there a fixed price that   they buy back at? Sometimes.  I'd think a \"fixed price tender offer\" would imply a fixed price though the open market way may take various prices. If I own shares in that company, can I get them to buy back my shares? Selective Buy-Backs is noted in Wikipedia as: \"In broad terms, a selective buy-back is one in which identical offers are not made to every shareholder, for example, if offers are made to only some of the shareholders in the company. In the US, no special shareholder approval of a selective buy-back is required. In the UK, the scheme must first be approved by all shareholders, or by a special resolution (requiring a 75% majority) of the members in which no vote is cast by selling shareholders or their associates. Selling shareholders may not vote in favor of a special resolution to approve a selective buy-back. The notice to shareholders convening the meeting to vote on a selective buy-back must include a statement setting out all material information that is relevant to the proposal, although it is not necessary for the company to provide information already disclosed to the shareholders, if that would be unreasonable.\" Thus it is possible, though how probable is another question. While not in the question, something to consider is how the buybacks can be done as a result of offsetting the dilution of employees who have stock options that may exercise them and spread the earnings over more shares, but this is more on understanding the employee stock option scenario that various big companies use when it comes to giving employees an incentive to help the stock price.   \n",

So you can actually sell the shares on ex-dividend date and still get the dividends. Ex-dividend date occurs before the record date and payment date, so you will get the dividend even if you sold before the record date.   \n",

You can buy stock after taking a cash advance from your credit card. When you make a cash advance, you normally pay the credit card company a fee. When you make a regular purchase, the merchant (ie, the stockbroker) pays a fee. Additionally, credit card companies can make merchants wait up to 3 months to actually receive the money, in case the transaction is disputed. Your stockbroker is unlikely to want to pay the fee, accept the delay in receiving the funds, and risking that you will dispute the transaction. Having said that, many FOREX brokers will accept credit card deposits (treated as purchases), although FOREX can be considerably riskier than the stock market. Of course, if you max out your credit cards and lose all your money, you can normally negotiate to pay back the debt for less than the original amount, especially since it's unsecured debt.   \n",

In the US these are called certificates of deposit or savings accounts.  Every run-of-the-mill bank offers them.  You give the bank money and in return they pay you an interest rate that is some fraction of or (negative) offset from the returns they expect to make from your money. Since most investments that a bank makes (say, loaning money to a local business) are themselves based on some multiple of or (positive) offset from the prime rate, in return the interest rate that they offer you is also mathematically based on the prime rate. You can find lists of banks offering the best returns on CDs or savings accounts at sites like BankRate.   \n",

Go to your bank or credit union and get a loan commitment. When applying for loan get the maximum amount they will let you borrow assuming that you will no longer own the first car. Take the car to a dealer and get a written estimate for selling the car. Pick one that gives you an estimate that is good for a week or ten days. You now know a data point for the trade-in value. Finally go to the dealer where you will buy the replacement car. Negotiate the price, tell them you don't need financing and you will not be trading in the car. Get all you can regarding rebates and other special incentives. Once you have a solid in writing commitment, then ask about financing and trade in. If they beat the numbers you have regarding interest rate and trade-in value accept those parts of the deal. But don't let them change anything else. If you keep the bank financing the dealer will usually give you a couple of days to get a check.  If you decide to ell the car to the first dealer do so as soon as you pick up the replacement car. If you try to start with the dealer you are buying the car from they will keep adjusting the rate, length of loan, trade-in value, and price until you have no idea if you are getting a good deal.   \n",

That rule suggests that you are at 65%stock/35% bond/cash. If you are comfortable having this money 100% invested, the best advice would be dollar cost averaging, anything more specific would suggest market timing.   \n",

There is no any rule of thumb. This solely depends on your trading strategy. I will share my own experience. My day starts with the daily chart, if I have a signal, either I open my position or I check 30 minute chart to make sure that it won't go too much against my trade. and I open my position. If I am waiting for the signal the minimum timeframe is 4 hours for me. I use 30 minutes to find the best time to enter the market. So, this is totally something special for my trading strategy, that is why those things can change based on the different strategies. I also check weekly and monthly charts to confirm trend. I have been busy with forex since 2007 and I am a verified investor on etoro At the end, I never use 1,5,15,60 minute charts as they are against my strategy.   \n",

Most stocks nowadays are registered electronically and thus the physical stock will be of no value - it will just be a certificate saying that you own X amount of shares in company X; but this information is at the same time registered electronically. Stocks are not like bearer bonds, the certificate itself contains no value and is registered to each individual/entity. Because the paper itself is worthless, stealing it will not affect your amount of stock with the company.  This is true for most stocks - there may exist companies who live in the 70s and do not keep track of their stock electronically, but I suspect it will only be very few (and most likely very small and illiquid companies).   \n",

You would buy the equivalent, cheaper option if it was available, but the store has little interest in offering multiple, competing options that would drive their same store revenue down. And the competing stores (Grocery, Department, Drug, Card) have similar overhead costs (floor space, lights, personnel). Most carry the cards for incremental revenue, and observe little advantage to lower price for a card (customers seldom buy more cards due to a lower price). Thus they mark the price to what (most) customers are willing to pay. You may choose to shop the various stores and find the one that has a (slightly) better pricing for cards, and then stop at that store when you want to buy a card. But many cards are sold as an incremental purchase as part of a larger shopping trip (convenience), as the customer combines trips (reduce the time spent shopping, albeit not reducing the money spent).   \n",

Often, one can be in a phaseout of some benefit, so that even though you're in a certain tax bracket, the impact of the next $100 is greater than the bracket rate alone. Taxation of social security benefits is one such anomaly. It can be high, but never over 100%. Update - The Affordable Care Act contains such an anomaly - go to the Kaiser Foundation site, and see the benefit a family of three might receive. A credit for up to $4631 toward their health care insurance cost. But, increase the income to above $78120 Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and the benefit drops to zero. The fact that the next dollar of income will cost you $4631 in the lost credit is an example of a step-function in the tax code. I'd still not turn down the raise, but I'd ask that it be deposited to my 401(k). And when reconciling my taxes each April, I'd use an IRA in case I still went over a bit. Consider, it's April, and your MAGI is $80,120. Even if you don't have to cash to deposit to the IRA, you borrow it, from a 24% credit card if need be. Because the $2000 IRA will trigger not just $300 less Federal tax, but a $4631 health care credit.  Note - the above example will apply to a limited, specific group who are funding their own health care expense and paying above a certain percent of income. It's not a criticism of ACA, just a mathematical observation appropriate to this question. For those in this situation, a close look at their projected MAGI is in order.  Another example - the deduction for college tuition and fees.  This is another \"step function.\" Go a dollar over the threshold, $130K joint, and the deduction drops from $4000 to $2000. You can claim that a $2000 deduction is a difference of 'only' $500 in tax due, but the result is a quick spike in the marginal rate. For those right at this number, it would be worth it to increase their 401(k) deduction to get back under this limit.   \n",

To put things in perspective, we are probably talking about less than $5,000 in tax savings.   If she is on the title then she is a co-owner.  Are you okay with that?  You would essentially be giving this child a 50% stake in a property without compensation.  Will your other children be okay with it? As your question stated you would prefer to not have her as an owner.  However, is it better to not have her as an owner, So I would buy the condo without her on the title and just pay the extra $100 per month in property tax.  It is probably \"small potatoes\" in comparison to your net worth. I would also only charge her at most your cost of carrying the property as rent.  While you will create income all of it (and probably more) could be written off as costs.  There should be no income tax burden created from this situation.  Your accountant can help with any paperwork that needs to be filed.   \n",

Likewise, you also have a lot of variables right now and the resolution of those variables will affect how much you can afford in the way of a home. The less surprises the better. As I'm sure you know, being a home owner can be quite expensive and if something ends to be repaired then you have to pay for it out of your own pocket, at least when you are renting that falls onto someone else. Likewise, unless you are confident that the market has bottomed out by you, you might find that you are underwater on the mortgage once everything is said and done. If you want to start making process towards buying a home though, you could check to see if any of the local banks or credit unions have some sort of savings program where you get higher interest rates in exchange for designating the savings for the down payment on a mortgage. Likewise, you could just find a high yield savings account and start making automatic transfers into it every month.   \n",

This is a state-run defined benefit plan, where the benefit is calculated based on the length of the employment and the contributed amounts. This is what in the US is known as the Social Security.  This is a defined contribution plan, where the employee can chose the level of risk based on certain pre-defined investment guidelines (more conservative or more aggressive). In Poland, it appears that there's a certain amount of the state-mandated SS tax is transferred to these plans. Nothing in the US is like that, but you can see it as a mandatory IRA with a preset limited choice of mutual funds to invest into, as an analogy. The recent change was to reduce the portion of the madatory contribution that is diverted to this plan from 7+% to 2.3% (on account of expanding the contribution to (1)). Probably the recent crashes of the stock markets that affected these accounts lead to this decision. This is voluntary defined contribution plan, similar to the US 401Ks.

The bank will have to fill out federal paperwork if there are large amounts of cash involved.  This is to stop the underground economy.  This can even extend to non-banks. If you were to walk into a car dealer or some other stores and hand them a bag  of cash they will also report it. You can do what you propose without having to transfer any money between accounts. Your girlfriend can put the furniture and landscaping on her credit card, or write checks to the stores or companies. Based on the number of questions on this site regarding how to transfer funds between banks and accounts, the mechanics of the transfer is the hard part. Resist the urge to use cash to make the transfer. That will require paperwork. Many people find that the old standard of using checks to transfer funds is easy, safe and quick.   \n",

You are now contributing less pre-tax, so your taxable income has increased. If you make no other changes, then in April you will either have increased your refund by 6 months x the additional $25 a month, or decreased the amount you owe by the same amount. There is no change in the total 401K balance at the end of the year, other than accounting for how much is held pre-tax vs. Roth post-tax. Keep in mind that employer contributions must be pre-tax. The company could never guess what your tax situation is. They withhold money for taxes based on the form you fill out, but they have no idea of your family's tax situation. If you fail to have enough withheld, you pay the penalty â€” not the company. *The tax savings are complex because it depends on marital status, your other pre-tax amounts for medical, and how much income your spouse makes, plus your other income and deductions.   \n",

Back in the 1970s, maybe the 1980s, stock brokers would occasionally send their retail clients a complimentary copy once in a while. Also, I remember the local newspaper would offer a year-end edition for a few dollars (maybe $3) and that edition would include the newspaper company's name on the cover. They were very handy little guides measuring 5 1/2 x 8 (horizontal) with one line devoted to each company. They listed hundreds of publicly traded companies and had basic info on each company. As you stated, for further info you needed to go to the library and follow-up with the big S&P and/or Moody's manuals. That was long before the internet made such info available at the click of a button on a home computer!   \n",
       "58   It depends on your investment profile but basically, dividends increase your taxable income. Anyone making an income will effectively get 'lower returns' on their investments due to this effect. If you had the choice between identical shares that either give a dividend or don't, you'll find that stock that pays a dividend has a lower price, and increases in value more slowly than stock that doesn't. (all other things being equal)  There's a whole bunch of economic theory behind this but in short, the current stock price is a measure of how much the company is worth combined with an estimation of how much it will be worth in the future (NPV of all future dividends is the basic model). When the company makes profit, it can keep those profits, and invest in new projects or distribute a portion of those profits to shareholders (aka dividends). Distributing the value to shareholders reduces the value of the company somewhat, but the shareholders get the money now. If the company doesn't give dividends, it has a higher value which will be reflected in a higher stock price.  So basically, all other things being equal (which they rarely are, but I digress) the price and growth difference reflects the fact that dividends are paying out now. (In other words, if you wanted non-dividend shares you could get them by buying dividend shares and re-investing the dividend as new shares every time there was a payout, and you could get dividend-share like properties by selling a percentage of non-dividend shares periodically). Dividend income is taxable as part of your income right away, however taxes on capital gains only happen when you sell the asset in question, and also has a lower tax rate. If you buy and hold Berkshire Hatheway, you will not have to pay taxes on the gains you get until you decide to sell the shares, and even then the tax rate will be lower. If you are investing for retirement, this is great, since your income from other sources will be lower, so you can afford to be taxed then. In many jurisdictions, income from capital gains is subject to a different tax rate than the rest of your income, for example in the US for most people with money to invest it's either 15% or 20%, which will be lower than normal income tax would be (since most people with money to invest would be making enough to be in a higher bracket). Say, for example, your income now is within the 25% bracket. Any dividend you get will be taxed at that rate, so let's say that the dividend is about 2% and the growth of the stock is about 4%. So, your effective growth rate after taxation is 5.5% -- you lose 0.5% from the 25% tax on the dividend. If, instead, you had stock with the same growth but no dividend it would grow at a rate of 6%. If you never withdrew the money, after 20 years, $1 in the dividend stock would be worth ~$2.92 (1.055^20), whereas $1 in the non-dividend stock would be worth ~$3.21 (1.06^20). You're talking about a difference of 30 cents per dollar invested, which doesn't seem huge but multiply it by 100,000 and you've got yourself enough money to renovate your house purely out of money that would have gone to the government instead. The advantage here is if you are saving up for retirement, when you retire you won't have much income so the tax on the gains (even ignoring the capital gains effect above) will definitely be less then when you were working, however if you had a dividend stock you would have been paying taxes on the dividend, at a higher rate, throughout the lifetime of the investment.  So, there you go, that's what Mohnish Pabrai is talking about. There are some caveats to this. If the amount you are investing isn't large, and you are in a lower tax bracket, and the stock pays out relatively low dividends you won't really feel the difference much, even though it's there. Also, dividend vs. no dividend is hardly the highest priority when deciding what company to invest in, and you'll practically never be able to find identical companies that differ only on dividend/no dividend, so if you find a great buy you may not have a choice in the matter.  Also, there has been a trend in recent years to also make capital gains tax progressive, so people who have a higher income will also pay more in capital gains, which negates part of the benefit of non-dividend stocks (but doesn't change the growth rate effects before the sale).  There are also some theoretical arguments that dividend-paying companies should have stronger shareholders (since the company has less capital, it has to 'play nice' to get money either from new shares or from banks, which leads to less risky behavior) but it's not so cut-and-dried in real life.   \n",

Other methods of currency exchange have much, much less volume though so it is important to understand the trading through markets as best as possible. Some banks do give information on how much is traded so surveys can give a reasonable indication of relative volume by currency.  Note the U.S. Dollar  is by far the largest volume of currency traded partially because people often covert one currency to another in the markets by trading \"through\" the Dollar.  Wikipedia has a good explanation and a nicely formatted table of information as well.   \n",

Decades ago, economists thought inflation corresponded with periods of high growth and good real returns, but since then we have had periods of low inflation and high growth and high inflation with low growth.  It is generally understood among current economists that inflation levels (especially expected inflation) are neither indicative nor causative of real stock returns. Many things can affect inflation, and economic performance is only a minor one.  Many things can cause economic performance, and inflation is only a minor one.  It's not clear whether the overall relation between inflation and real stock returns is positive or negative. Notice, however, that in principle stock returns are real.  That is, the money companies make is in inflated dollars so profit and dividends for a company whose prospects have not changed should go up and down at the same rate as inflation. This would mean if inflation goes up by 5% and nothing else changes, you would expect stock prices to go up by the same proportion so you wouldn't have strong feelings about inflation one way or the other.  In real life stock prices will go up by either more or less than 5% but I'm not comfortable saying which, on average. Bottom line: current levels of inflation can't really be used to predict real stock returns, so you shouldn't let current inflation guide your decision about whether to buy stock.   \n",

For example, Microsoft is traded on NASDAQ, which is a stock exchange. An analogy that can be made is that of selling a used car. When you sell a used car to a third person, the maker of your car is unaffected by this transaction and the same goes for stock trading. Still within the same analogy, when the car is first sold, money goes directly to the maker (actually more complicated than that but good enough for our purposes). In the case of stock trading, this is called an Initial Public Offering (IPO) / Seasoned Public Offering (SPO), for most purposes. What this means is that a drop of value on a secondary market does not directly affect earning potential. Let me add some nuance to this. Say this drop from 20$ to 10$ is permanent and this company needs to finance itself through equity (stock) in the future. It is likely that it would not be able to obtain as much financing in this matter and would either 1) have to rely more on debt and raise its cost of capital or 2) obtain less financing overall. This could potentially affect earnings through less cash available from financing. One last note: in any case, financing does not affect earnings except through cost of capital (i.e. interest paid) because it is neither revenue nor expense. Financing obtained from debt increases assets (cash) and liabilities (debt) and financing obtained from stock issuance increases assets (cash) and shareholder equity.   \n",

(See this article for the mexican case, the introduction has a list of other articles you could read on the subject). In some cases parity doesn't seem to be reached, which may have to do with transaction costs, the risk of transacting in a foreign market, as well as administrative & legal concerns that can affect the direct holder of a foreign share but don't impact the ADR holder (since those risks and costs are borne by the institution, which presumably has a better idea of how to manage such risks and costs). It's also worth pointing out that there are almost always arbitrage opportunities that get snapped up quickly: the law of one price doesn't apply for very short time-frames, just that if you're not an expert in that particular domain of the market, it might as well be a law since you won't see the arbitrage opportunities fast enough. That is to say, there are always opportunities for arbitrage with ADRs but chances are YOU won't be able to take advantage of it (In the Mexican case, the price divergence seems to have an average half-life of ~3 days). Some price divergence might be expected: ADR holders shouldn't be expected to know as much about the foreign market as the typical foreign share holder, and that uncertainty may also cause some divergence. There does seem to be some opportunity for arbitrage doing what you suggest in markets where it is not legally possible to short shares, but that likely is the value added from being able to short a share that belongs to a market where you can't do that.   \n",

They have handled it two different ways. They accepted a small check ~$1,000 now, and then gave me three business days to bring the rest as a cashiers check. They also insisted that I submit a application for credit, in case I needed a loan.  They accepted a personal check on the spot. Ask them before you drive to the dealer. Of course they would love you to get a loan from them.   \n",

From a UK perspective, this should be perfectly legal. If it's just a one-off or occasional thing for personal reasons, rather than being done in the course of a business, there probably aren't any tax implications. In theory if there's an identifiable profit from the transaction, e.g. because you originally obtained the INR at a lower exchange rate, then you might be liable to capital gains tax. However this is only payable above approximately Â£10K capital gains (see http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/rates/cgt.htm) so unless this is a very large transaction or you have other gains in the tax year, you don't need to worry about that. I would only recommend doing this if you trust each other. If one side transfers the money and the other doesn't, the international nature will make it quite hard in practice to enforce the agreement legally, even though I think that in theory it should be possible. If the sums involved are large, you may find that the transaction is automatically reported to the authorities by your bank under money laundering regulations, or they may want documentation of the source of the funds/reason for the transaction. This doesn't automatically mean you'll have a problem, but the transaction may receive some scrutiny. I think that reporting typically kicks in when several thousand pounds are involved.   \n",

The rules relating to occupancy and frequency may be different for some purposes if you go from yearly or monthly tenants to daily-rate tenants.  Your state and local authorities may in the future try to consider you a motel or Bed n Breakfast equivalent, and subject you to various regulations and business taxes.  But the method of finding customers itself is probably not meaningful for tax purposes.   \n",

If the counterparty refuses to pay immediately they will, in the first instance be billed by any intermediary (Prime Broker etc.) that facilitated the contract. If they still refuse to pay the contract may stipulate that a broker can \"net off\" any outstanding payments against it or pay out using deposited cash or posted margins. The contract will usually include the broker as an interested party and so they can, but don't need to, report a default (such that this is) to credit agencies (in some jurisdictions they are required to by law). Any parties to the trade and the courts may use a debt collection agency to collect payments or seize assets to cover payment. If there is no broker or the counterparty still has not paid the bill then the parties involved (the party to the trade and any intermediaries) can sue for breach of contract. If they win (which would be expected) the counterparty will be made to pay by the legal system including, but not limited to, seizure of assets, enforced bankruptcy, and prison terms for any contempts of court rulings. All of this holds for governments who refuse to pay derivatives losses (as Argentina did in the early 20th century) but in that case it may escalate as far as war. It has never done so for derivatives contracts as far as I know but other breaches of contract between countries have resulted in armed conflict. As well as the \"hard\" results of failing to pay there are soft implications including a guaranteed fall in credit ratings that will result in parties refusing to do business with the counterparty and a separate loss of reputation that will reduce business even further. Potential employees and funders will be unwilling to become involved with such a party and suppliers will be unwilling to supply on credit. The end result in almost every way would be bankruptcy and prison sentences for the party or their senior employees. Most jurisdictions allow for board members at companies in material breach of contract to be banned from running any company for a set period as well. edit: netting off cash flows netting off is a process whereby all of a party's cash flows, positive and negative, are used to pay each other off so that only the net change is reflected in account balances, for example: company 1 cash flows netting off the total outgoings are 3M + 500k = 3.5M and total incomings are 1.2M + 1.1M + 1.2M = 3.5M so the incoming cash flows can be used to pay the outgoing cash flows leaving a net payment into company1's account of 0.   \n",

It may take a few hours to balance the current buy/sell orders and open the stock. Watch CNBC when a hot IPO is about to open and you'll see the process in real time. If you miss it, look at a one day Yahoo chart to see when the open occurred.   \n",

There are no guarantees of how long you can keep it for your short, or the cost involved to hold it.  Usually, everyone knows about a particular set-up (e.g. a warrant or convertible bond mispricing) that is attractive for arbitrage. This causes the associated stock to be in high demand thus expensive to borrow for shorting, or impossible to find for any price at all.   \n",

The important thing is to read both positive and negative views and do some of your additional research and form your own opinion. To answer your question, some analysts don't provide price targets, some just say \"Buy\", \"Sell\", \"Hold\", and others actually give you a price target. Yahoo provides a good resource for collecting reports and giving you a price target. http://screener.finance.yahoo.com/reports.html   \n",

You can chose to send ('wire') the money in source currency or in US $; the former, the target bank in the US does the conversion (so pick one that adds no or little spread); the latter, the sending bank does the conversion (so ask about their fees/spreads). I have multiple times transferred money across the ocean (though not from Japan), and never paid more than 0.3% + ~40 $ flat. It should be possible to get te same range. Note that if you look around for current offers, you might be easily able to even make some money on it - some US banks are eager for new money, and offer 200+$ bonus if you open an account and bring (significant =15k$+) new money to them.   \n",

It just devalues the money they already have. So it will just take more money to buy goods from another country. Printing money will also lead to over inflation which has its own set of problems such as:   \n",
       "76                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       It's simply supply and demand.   First, demand: If you're an importer trying to buy from overseas, you'll need foreign currency, maybe Euros.  Or if you want to make a trip to Europe you'll need to buy Euros.  Or if you're a speculator and think the USD will fall  in value, you'll probably buy Euros. Unless there's someone willing to sell you Euros for dollars, you can't get any.  There are millions of people trying to exchange currency all over the world.  If more want to buy USD, than that demand will positively influence the price of the USD (as measured in Euros).  If more people want to buy Euros, well, vice versa. There are so many of these transactions globally, and the number of people and the nature of these transactions change so continuously, that the prices (exchange rates) for these currencies fluctuate continuously and smoothly. Demand is also impacted by what people want to buy and how much they want to buy it.  If people generally want to invest their savings in stocks instead of dollars, i.e., if lots of people are attempting to buy stocks (by exchanging their dollars for stock), then the demand for the dollar is lower and the demand for stocks is higher.  When the stock market crashes, you'll often see a spike in the exchange rate for the dollar, because people are trying to exchange stocks for dollars (this represents a lot of demand for dollars). Then there's \"Supply:\" It may seem like there are a fixed number of bills out there, or that supply only changes when Bernanke prints money, but there's actually a lot more to it than that.  If you're coming from Europe and want to buy some USD from the bank, well, how much USD does the bank \"have\" and what does it mean for them to have money?  The bank gets money from depositors, or from lenders.  If one person puts money in a deposit account, and then the bank borrows that money from the account and lends it to a home buyer in the form of a mortgage, the same dollar is being used by two people.  The home buyer might use that money to hire a carpenter, and the carpenter might put the dollar back into a bank account, and the same dollar might get lent out again.  In economics this is called the \"multiplier effect.\" The full supply of money being used ends up becoming harder to calculate with this kind of debt and re-lending.   Since money is something used and needed for conducting of transactions, the number of transactions being conducted (sometimes on credit) affects the \"supply\" of money. Demand and supply blur a bit when you consider people who hoard cash.  If I fear the stock market, I might keep all my money in dollars.  This takes cash away from companies who could invest it, takes the cash out of the pool of money being used for transactions, and leaves it waiting under my mattress.  You could think of my hoarding as a type of demand for currency, or you could think of it as a reduction in the supply of currency available to conduct transactions. The full picture can be a bit more complicated, if you look at every way currencies are used globally, with swaps and various exchange contracts and futures, but this gives the basic story of where prices come from, that they are not set by some price fixer but are driven by market forces.   The bank just facilitates transactions.  If the last price (exchange rate) is 1.2 Dollars per Euro, and the bank gets more requests to buy USD for Euros than Euros for USD, it adjusts the rate downwards until the buying pressure is even.  If the USD gets more expensive, at some point fewer people will want to buy it (or want to buy products from the US that cost USD).  The bank maintains a spread (like buy for 1.19 and sell for 1.21) so it can take a profit. You should think of currency like any other commodity, and consider purchases for currency as a form of barter.  The value of currency is merely a convention, but it works.  The currency is needed in transactions, so it maintains value in this global market of bartering goods/services and other currencies.  As supply and demand for this and other commodities/goods/services fluctuate, so does the quantity of any particular currency necessary to conduct any of these transactions. A official \"basket of goods\" and the price of those goods is used to determine consumer price indexes / inflation etc.  The official price of this particular basket of goods is not a fundamental driver of exchange rates on a day to day basis.   \n",

For example, you work full time job (8 hours a day) at $20/hour. At the end of the 1st day of the month, you'd add $160 to your salary account. You've earned it, even though its still almost a month till you actually get paid. So its accrued. What if you don't get paid? You've accrued it already, its on your books, but not in your wallet. You might have paid taxes on it, etc. But you don't really have it. This is what is called \"bad debt\", and eventually, after you can show that the payee is not going to pay, you write it off - remove it from your books (and adjust your taxes etc that you paid on that income already). Generally, it is a very bad idea to use accrual method of accounting for an individual or a small business. For large volume business using accrual mode solves other accounting and revenue recognition problems.   \n",

Changes in exchange rates are a little more interesting because they suggest economic changes (or anticipation of such), but since the exchange rate is the composite of many economic forces, determining what changes may be in action from an exchange rate change is not really possible.   \n",

Investing all your money into one stock, bond, Mutual fund, ETF is risky if that one segment of the economy/market suffers.  There is a drawback to diversification of accounts. Some have minimum amounts and fee structures. In the original question you asked about 1,000 per account. That may mean that some accounts may be closed to you. In other cases they will charge a higher percentage for fees for small accounts. Those issues would disappear long before you hit the 1,000,000 per account you mentioned in your comment. One problem can occur with having too much diversification. Having dozens of funds could mean that the overlap between the funds might result in over investing in a segment because you didn't realize that one stock segment appeared in 1/3 of the funds.   \n",

The parliament rightfully refused, and it didn't pass. In the EU, and Cyprus as part of it, all bank deposits are insured up to 100,000EUR by the government. This is similar to the US FDIC insurance. Thus, requiring the \"small\" (up to 100K) depositors to participate in the bank reorganization means that the government breaks its word to people, and effectively defaults. That is exactly what the Cyprus government wanted to avoid, the default, so I can't understand why the idea even came up. Depositors of more than 100k are not guaranteed against bank failures, and indeed - in Cyprus these depositors will get \"haircuts\". But before them, first come shareholders and bondholders who would be completely wiped out. Thus, first and foremost, those who failed (the bank owners) will be the first to pay the price. However, governments can default. This happened in many places, for example in Russia in the 90's, in Argentina in 2000's (and in fact numerous times during the last century), the US in the 1930's, and many other examples - you can see a list in Wikipedia. When government defaults on its debts, it will not pay some or all of them, and its currency may also be devaluated. For example, in Russia in 1998 the currency lost 70% of its value against the USD within months, and much of the cash at hands of the public became worthless overnight. In the US in 1933 the President issued an executive order forbidding private citizens keeping gold and silver bullions and coins, which resulted in dollar devaluation by about 30% and investors in precious metals losing large amounts of money. The executive order requiring surrender of the Treasury gold certificates is in fact the government's failure to pay on these obligations. While the US or Russia control their own currency, European countries don't and cannot devaluate the currency as they wish in order to ease their debts. Thus in Euro-zone the devaluation solutions taken by Russia and the US are not possible. Cyprus cannot devaluate its currency, and even if it could - its external debt would not likely to be denominated in it (actually, Russian debt isn't denominated in Rubles, that's why they forced restructuring of their own debt, but devaluating the currency helped raising the money from the citizens similarly to the US seizing the gold in 1930's). Thus, in case of Cyprus or other Euro-zone countries, direct taxes is the only way to raise money from the citizens. So if you're in a country that controls its own currency (such as the US, Russia, Argentina, etc) and especially if the debt is denominated in that currency (mainly the US) - you should be worried more of inflation than taxes. But if you're in the Euro-zone and your country is in troubles (which is almost any country in the zone) - you can expect taxes. How to avoid that? Deal with your elected officials and have them fix your economy, but know that you can't just \"erase\" the debt through inflation as the Americans can (and will), someone will have to pay.   \n",

If you are interested in saving and investing, this is a great site to visit. Please take the tour and just start to read the questions you find interesting.  1 - even though this is hypothetical, it scales down to an average investor. If I own 1000 shares of the 1 billion, am I liable if the company goes under? No. Stocks don't work that way. If all I have is shares, not a short position, not options, I can only see my investment go to zero.  2 - Here, I'd ask that you edit your country in the tags. I can tell you that my newborn (who is soon turning 17) had a stock account in her name when she was a few months old. It's still a custodian account, meaning an adult has to manage it, and depending on the state within the US, the age that it's hers with no adult, is either 18 or 21. Your country may have similar regional rules.  Also - each country has accounts specifically geared toward retirement, with different favorable rules regarding taxation. In the US, we have accounts that can be funded at any age, so long as there's earned income. My daughter started one of these accounts when she started baby sitting at age 12. She will have more in her account by the time she graduates college than the average retiree does. It's good for her, and awful for the general population that this is the case.   \n",

I can't speak to the LSE, but in the US, there is a mandated firewall between the individual and the exchange, the broker; therefore, in the US, one would have to start a business and become a broker. If that process is too costly, the broker or trade platform that permits individuals to trade with the lowest commissions is the next lowest.   \n",

When you hold a short (sold) call option position that has an underlying price that is increasing, what will happen (in general) is that your net margin requirements will increase day by day.  Thus, you will be required to put up more money as margin to finance your position.  Margin money is simply a \"good faith\" deposit held by your broker.  It is not money that is debited as cash from the accounting ledger of your trading account, but is held by your broker to cover any potential losses that may arise when you finally settle you position.   Conversely, when the underlying share price is decreasing, the net margin requirements will tend to decrease day by day.   (Net margin is the net of \"Initial Margin\" and \"Variation Margin\".) As the expiry date approaches, the \"time value\" component of the option price will be decreasing.   \n",

Here are the many signs: The bank will never ask for your password. They can access your account without it.  The bank will never use a customer's account for their own business. They have their own accounts.  \"Some guy\" is not a bank employee. Bank employees are people that you meet at the bank.  Banks do not hand out thousands of dollars for free to customers, especially customers with nothing in their accounts.  Even if you have no money in the account, this crook that you would give access to your account can do lots of illegal things in your name, such as writing bad checks, laundering money, running scams on other people through your account, etc. If you have already given your account info to this person, you need to go to the bank immediately and inform them. Since you have no money in the account, you should close it.   \n",

That way, the funds are in one central account and available to invest. Plus it eliminates the mandatory 20% withholding if the rollover is indirect and is sent to you first before the deposit into the new plan. It is important to bear in mind that you have 60 calendar days from the date of distribution to get the full amount into the new plan and a rollover is considered a tax reportable, but not necessarily a taxable event provided you deposit the funds within the time frame allotted.   \n",

You could open a brokerage account with a broker and buy shares in each of these companies, but the easiest, least expensive way to invest in all these stocks is to invest in an S&P 500 index mutual fund. Inside an index mutual fund, your money will be pooled together with everyone else in the fund to purchase all the stocks in the index.  These types of funds are very low expense compared to managed mutual funds.  Most mutual fund companies have an S&P 500 index fund; two examples are Vanguard and Fidelity.  The minimum investment in most of these mutual funds is low enough that you will be able to open an account with your $4000. Something you need to keep in mind, however: investing in any stock mutual fund is not non-risk.  It's not even low-risk, really.  It is very possible to lose money by investing in the stock market.  An S&P 500 index fund is diversified in the sense that you have money in lots of different stocks, but it is also not diversified, in a sense, because it is all in large cap American stocks.  Before investing in the stock market, you should have a goal for the money you are investing.  If you are investing for something several years away, an index fund can be a good place to invest, but if you will need this money within the next few years, the stock market might be too risky for you.   \n",

See Weiss Research website, ratings section for a very different perspective on Martin Weiss's work than the websites with which he is now associated. I checked both links provided, and agree with the questioner in every way: These appear to be highly questionable investment research websites. I use such strong terms based on the fact that the website actually uses the distasteful pop-up ploy,  \"Are you SURE you want to leave this site?\" Clearly, something changed between what Weiss Ratings was in the past (per company history since 1971) and what Martin Weiss is doing now. Larry Edelson seems to have been associated exclusively with questionable websites and high pressure investment advice since 2007. From 1996 through the present, he worked as either an employee or contractor of Weiss Research. Let's answer each of your questions.  On June 22, 2006, the Commission instituted settled administrative   proceedings against Weiss Research, Inc., Martin Weiss, and Lawrence   Edelson (collectively, â€œRespondentsâ€) for violations of the Investment   Advisers Act of 1940 in connection with their operation of an   unregistered investment adviser and the production and distribution of   materially false and misleading marketing materials. Full details about Weiss Ratings operations, including its history from 1996 through 2001, when it operated in compliance with securities laws, then from 2001 through 2005, which was when the SEC filed charges for regulatory violations, are available from the June 2006 U.S. SEC court documents PDF. Finally, this quantitative assessment, \"Safe With Martin Weiss? (December 2010) by CXO Advisory (providers of \"objective research and reviews to aid investing decisions\") for its readers concluded the following: In summary, the performance of Martin Weissâ€™ premium services in   aggregate over the past year is unimpressive. The study methodology was good, but I recommend reading the article (I posted the URL) to fully understand what caveats and assumptions were done to reach that conclusion.   \n",

If so they would label you day trader and in the US you are required to have at least $25K in your account. Maybe that's why they require you to add more money to your account?

The best thing to do is roll it to an IRA that isn't tied to work at all.  Second best is to roll it into your new employer's 401k.  The reason that an IRA makes sense is that it gives you the same tax savings as a 401k, but it allows you to remain in control of the money regardless of your employment status.   \n",

Most people don't realize that the cost to the company for a full-time employee with benefits can be 2x or even 3x the amount they see in their paycheck.  Health plans are extremely expensive. Even if you are having money taken from your check for health insurance, it is often just a fraction of the total cost, and the employer is subsidizing the rest.  More expensive benefits that contractors don't typically get are 401K matches and paid vacation days. When contractors call in sick or don't work because it is a national holiday, they don't get paid for that day. Also, see that line on your paycheck deducting for Social security and Medicare? That is only half of the tax. The employer pays an equal amount that is not shown on that statement. Also, they pay taxes that go towards unemployment benefits , and may be required to pay higher taxes if they churn through a lot of full-time employees. You can usually let contractors go with relative impunity . For the unemployment tax reasons, not paying for people's days off or benefits, a lot less paperwork, and less risk to the business associated with committing to full-time employees all provide value to the company. Thus companies are willing to pay more because they are getting more.  Think of it like a cell phone-contract. If you commit to a three year contract it can be a pain/expensive to get out of the deal early, but you will probably get a better rate in exchange for the risk being shifted to your end of the deal.   \n",

This is same as cash dividends. You would receive the additional stock.   \n",

Open net buy quantity represents the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a 3-day settlement cycle. Open net buy quantity must be less than 5,000,000 shares per stock for your entire firm Basically, you can't hold a long position of more than 5 million shares in an illiquid OTC stock without facing a fee. You'll still be assessed this fee if you accumulate a long position of this size by breaking your purchase up into multiple transactions. Open net sell quantity represents the total unsettled share amount per stock at any given time during a 3-day settlement cycle. Open net sell quantity must be less than 10% percent of the 20-day average volume If you attempt to sell a number of shares greater than 10% of the stock's average volume over the last 20 days, you'll also be assessed a fee. The first link I included above is just an example, but it makes the important point: you may still be assessed a fee for trading OTC stocks even if your account doesn't meet the criteria because these restrictions are applied at the level of the clearing firm, not the individual client.  This means that if other investors with your broker, or even at another broker that happens to use the same clearing firm, purchase more than 5 million shares in an individual OTC stock at the same time, all of your accounts may face fees, even though individually, you don't exceed the limits. Technically, these fees are assessed to the clearing firm, not the individual investor, but usually the clearing firm will pass the fees along to the broker (and possibly add other charges as well), and the broker will charge a fee to the individual account(s) that triggered the restriction. Also, remember that when buying OTC/pink sheet stocks, your ability to buy or sell is also contingent on finding someone else to buy from/sell to. If you purchase 10,000 shares one day and attempt to sell them sometime in the future, but there aren't enough buyers to buy all 10,000 from you, you might not be able to complete your order at the desired price, or even at all.   \n",

It's the time weighted average of all the payments you'll receive and helpful to understand the effect a change in rates will have on that instrument.  The duration of a stock, on the other hand, is a forced construct to then use in other equations to help calculate, say, the summation of a dividend stream. I can calculate the duration of a bond and come up with an answer that's not up for discussion or dispute. The duration of a stock, on the other hand, isn't such a number. Will J&J last 50 more years? Will Apple? Who knows?   \n",

Multiply by 12 to get 108.6% or calculate APR at 182.8%. Either way it's far more than 68%.  If the $1680 were paid after 365 days, it would be simple interest of 68%. For the fact that payment are made along the way, the numbers change.  Edit - A finance calculator has 5 buttons to cover the calculations:  N = number of periods or payments %i = the interest per period PV = present value PMT = Payment per period FV= Future value In your example, you've given us the number of periods, 12, present value, $1000, future value, 0, and payment, $140. The calculator tells me this is a monthly rate of 9%. As Dilip noted, you can compound as you wish, depending on what you are looking for, but the 9% isn't an opinion, it's the math. TI BA-35 Solar. Discontinued, but available on eBay. Worth every cent.  Per mhoran's comment, I'll add the spreadsheet version.  I literally copied and pasted his text into a open cell, and after entering the cell shows,  which I rounded to 9.05%. Note, the $1000 is negative, it starts as an amount owed.  And for Dilip - 1.0905^12 = 2.8281 or 182.8% effective rate. If I am the loanshark lending this money, charging 9% per month, my $1000 investment returns $2828 by the end of the year, assuming, of course, that the payment is reinvested immediately. The 108 >> 182 seems disturbing, but for lower numbers, even 12% per year, the monthly compounding only results in 12.68%   \n",

As a practical matter, it's less likely to be exercised until expiry or shortly prior. The way to think about paying a European option is: [Odds of paying out] = [odds that strike is in the money at expiry] Whereas the American option can be thought of as: [Odds of paying out] = [odds that strike price is in the money at expiry] + ( [odds that strike price is in the money prior to expiry] * [odds that other party will exercise early] ). This is just a heuristic, not a formal financial tool.  But the point is that you need to consider the odds that it will go into the money early, for how long (maybe over multiple periods), and how likely the counterparty is to exercise early. Important considerations for whether they will exercise early are the strategy of the other side (long, straddle, quick turnaround), the length of time the option is in the money early, and the anticipated future movement. A quick buck strategy might exercise immediately before the stock turns around.  But that could leave further gains on the table, so it's usually best to wait unless the expectation is that the stock will quickly reverse its movement.  This sort of counter-market strategy is generally unlikely from someone who bought the option at a certain strike, and is equivalent to betting against their original purchase of the option.  So most of these people will wait because they expect the possibility of a bigger payoff. A long strategy is usually in no hurry to exercise, and in fact they would prefer to wait until the end to hold the time value of the option (the choice to get out of the option, if it goes back to being unprofitable).  So it usually makes little sense for these people to exercise early.  The same goes for a straddle, if someone is buying an option for insurance or to economically exit a position. So you're really just concerned that people will exercise early and forgo the time value of the American option.  That may include people who really want to close a position, take their money, and move on.  In some cases, it may include people who have become overextended or need liquidity, so they close positions.  But for the most part, it's less likely to happen until the expiration approaches because it leaves potential value on the table.  The time value of an option dwindles at the end because the implicit option becomes less likely, especially if the option is fairly deep in the money (the implicit option is then fairly deep out of the money). So early exercise becomes more meaningful concern as the expiration approaches.  Otherwise, it's usually less worrisome but more than a nonzero proposition.   \n",

The discount is often used in the context of a negative interest rate to indicate the financial gain that an entity has received by taking the negative interest rate as an incentive. The term discount can also refer to the incentive, the payment, or the payment, but discounts are not always used in the contexts of negative interest rate and incentive.\\nIf you are familiar with the financial industry, you will realize that discounts are used in different contexts. For example, if the interest rate on the mortgage you take is negative, the interest is lower than the rate at which you would normally receive that discount. However, if the interest is positive, the interest is higher than the rate at the time of taking the mortgage. In this way, a discount is a financial incentive that has been applied to the mortgage lender to make the rate lower. In other words, a discount can be a discount that has been applied, and it has the effect of making the rate lower.\\nDiscount   \n",

My firm is a money services firm, but we are also a financial institution and we facilitate currency exchange. I have read that some of the banks that we have done business with have done so under the guise of facilitating the exchange of currency between private accounts and a bank. I have read about the banking industry in the US and I know that some banks have a very specific role in the financial sector. Do banks have a specific role in facilitating the movement of money from private accounts to banks? Do they have specific authority to issue loans? Are they required to do anything other than the exchange of currency?\\nYour response:\\nThe banking industry in general does not have a role in facilitated currency exchange, as we do not issue loans. We have, however, a specific role in the exchange of funds between private accounts and financial institutions, where we facilitate the exchange of funds in a way that is acceptable to both parties. This includes the exchange of funds for goods and services. We have a specialized relationship with banks and we work with them to ensure that they comply with our specific role as a financial institution   \n",

This can be a good cost savings if you are able to find a comparable unit that has similar amenities. If you are not able to find this kind of accommodation, then it's important to note that AirBnB does have a list of AirBnB units that are comparable. This can give you an idea of what the average price is for the unit you are considering.

Is there a difference between a cash dividend and a dividend from the stock I am selling?\\nIf you are selling a stock that is going up after the ex-day, but before the pay-day, and the dividend is paid on the pay-day (which is usually the day before the dividend is due), there is no difference between a cashed dividend and a cash dividends. A dividend from the share that is going up, is paid on the dividend pay-day. If you are selling the same stock at a higher price, you are selling it at the higher price.\\nI have a few questions about a company I am looking at.\\n1. Do I need to report a gain or loss on the income statement?\\n2. Is there a difference in the tax rate when the company has both a capital gain and a loss on income?\\n3.

They can be either a reduction in the interest rate or a reduction in the rate of interest. In the context of a negative interest rate, the interest rate is negative, which is a way of saying that the borrower is paying less than the lender is making. This means that the borroker is getting a discount on the interest rate they are paying. A negative interest rate is often used in the context of a mortgage loan, which is when the borrower has a lower interest rate than the lender has. This is a common practice in mortgage loans. However, if the borrower defaults on the mortgage, then the interest rate will be higher than the lender's interest rate.\\nIn the context of a positive interest rate, the borrower pays more than the lender does. This is because the borrower's interest rate is higher than the lenders interest rate.

The demand for that currency depends on the value of the foreign currency and the value of the currency that you are trading with. If the demand for the foreign currency is high, then the currency will be more expensive to buy than to sell. On the other hand, if the demand for the currency is low, then it will be more expensive for you to buy the currency than to sell it.\\nIn the case of the Euro, the exchange rate of this currency has been very volatile since 2002.

What is the impact of a default in the United States? In the United States, house prices are generally not affected by country defaults. There are a number of reasons for this. First, the U.S. government is very stable. There have been no major crises since the Great Depression. Second, U.S. banks are regulated by the Federal Reserve, which is independent of government. This means that they can lend without fear of default.\\nThere are several reasons that a country default can have a negative effect on the economy. First, a default can cause a drop in the value of the currency, which can affect the economy. This can be a serious problem for countries that rely on exports. Second, a default can lead to a decrease in investor confidence. This can make it more difficult for businesses to borrow money, and therefore hurt the economy. Third, a default can create instability in the financial system. This can make banks reluctant to lend money to businesses, which can have a negative impact on the economy.\\nIn the United States, the housing market has been very stable over the past several decades.

The aim of the policy is to reduce the money supply. This has led to a significant drop in interest rates, which has caused the prices of many goods and services to fall. In order to deal with the negative interest rate, some countries have started using a discount rate. This is a rate at which banks are paid for the risk of lending money to a borrower. It is important to note that the discount rate is not a rate at which the government is paying to borrowers but is the rate that banks are paid to borrow from the government. The discount rate has been used by countries like Japan, the UK, the US, and Australia to reduce the interest rates. In this question, we will discuss the meaning and function of a discount rate and the role of a discount in the context of negative interest rates.\\nThe term \"discount rate\" is used to describe the rate of interest charged by a bank on a loan.

One way is to view it as a measure of market volatility. In other words, VIX provides a \"snapshot\" of the market at a particular time. The second way to view VIX is to view it more as a \"proxy\" for market sentiment. In other words the more volatile the market, the higher VIX will rise. This \"proxy\" approach to viewing VIX does not require that the underlying market be \"snapshotted\" or \"synchronized\" with a specific date.

They want to buy stock that will continue to grow, not only in value but in profits. When a company's profits are increasing, then the shareholders can expect the company to continue to grow and increase in value. Growth can also be seen in terms of the increase in the number of shares of stock. The number of shares of a company will go up in proportion to the amount of money that the company is making.\\nP/E ratio measures the ratio between the price of a company's stock and its earnings per share. P/E ratio is used to determine whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. If the ratio is above 100, then the stock is overvaluated. If the ratio falls below 10, then the share price is undervalued.\\nGrowth is not the only factor that investors look at when buying stocks.

Investing is always a gamble, but the financial sector is very volatile and prone to large declines. For example, during the global financial crisis, the financial sector lost about 80% of its value. I've been wondering if there are international ETFs that focus on sectors other than the financial sector? My thought was that if there were, it would be interesting to see what their returns are.\\nThere is a company called \"Invesco Financial ETF\" that focuses on the financial sector, but the returns have been disappointing for the last few years. For example, their returns were 1.6% in 2008 and 1.2% in 2307.\\nThere are other ETFs that have tried to focus on the financial sector.

Apart from single stocks, a combination of mutual funds would be ideal.\\nMutual funds provide an opportunity to invest in many different types of stocks at the same time. This reduces the risk of investing in one single stock and gives you a good exposure to a number of stocks in a short period of time.\\nThere are various investment strategies and funds that can be selected for your portfolio. You should consider your investment goals, risk appetite and other factors before choosing a strategy.\\nSome of the popular strategies include value, growth, dividend and income. The most important factor to consider before investing in a single fund is your risk tolerance. If you have a high risk tolerance, you should go for a single stock fund as it provides more exposure to a single stock. If you have low risk tolerance, then a combination of funds is recommended.\\nAnother important factor to consider is the fees charged by the fund.

You are only permitted to deduct expenses that are directly associated with the business of selling your items.

One such technology that is being used widely is the credit card, which has revolutionized the way the money transactions are done. With the help of a credit card, you can make payments for the services you have received. It is also the most convenient way to make payments for your daily expenses.\\nHowever, there are some financial institutions that have started using the Credit Card Payment as a method of payment. These institutions are known as Demat/Stocks Brokers. They are using credit card payment for the transactions in stock broking.

The shares which a buyer buys and the shares which a seller sells are known as the assets and the liabilities respectively. The buyer and the seller exchange the shares of stock for money.\\nThis money is known as the payment. The payment is the exchange of shares of stock between two parties. The seller has to sell its shares of stock to the buyer. The buyer has to buy the shares of stock of the seller.

If they say no, you can ask for a meeting with them and let them know how you have been performing. If you have been doing a great job, you may have a better chance of getting a raise. If you have done a mediocre job, you may not have a chance of getting a higher salary.\\nI am not sure I would take a raise, but I can understand why others would take it.

Home Depot' was hit hard by the 1987 stock market crash. In 1986, they were able to sell off 18,000 stores. This move saved the company money by selling the stores that were not profitable. Home Depot was able to sell off these stores in 1978 and 1985. This was a good move for the company.\\nIn 1984, Home Depot started to buy up more stores and to make acquisitions. The acquisitions were made to give Home Depot the opportunity to compete with Lowe's. In 14 months, they bought 64 stores. This move helped Home Depot to increase their market share. They bought stores in the southeast, the Midwest, the Mid-Atlantic, the West, and in the South.

I am now thinking of using AirBnB.com to rent out a room or two in my home and have a guest stay at my home for a week or two.\\nIn the past, I have never been required to report AirBnB income. My question is if I rent out my home through AirBnB and someone uses my home as their residence, would I have to pay any taxes? I do not want to do this if I am required to pay taxes, but if I am not, then this is a great opportunity to increase my income. I will be using my home for the purpose of renting it out to people, not as a place where I live.\\nThanks for your help.\\nAirBnB has no tax implications if you rent your property out as a room. You must file a 1099 MISC, which is the form you would need to fill out to report rental income. You would have to file this as your own income and include the AirBnB fees as part of the income.\\n   \n",

There are various definitions and methods of defining poverty.\\nThe most common method is the 2005 World Bank definition. This is the one that most people in the West use when they talk about the concept of poverty. It is based on a simple formula. The formula is that in order to be considered poor, you must be less than $1.25 a day.\\nThere are also other methods. For example, the UN's poverty line is $1.90 a day, the UN'S absolute poverty line is the same, but the UN is much more flexible in how it applies its formula. The poorest countries in the world are those that are below the UN's absolute poverty line, which is $1.20 a day. The poorest people in the world are the   \n",

The answer is usually that you simply will need a financial planner if you need to have a strategy put in place. The reason for that is usually that the planner will not likely just help you with the expenditure.\\nThe expense to the planner is usually quite a bit higher than that of an expert investor. Nonetheless, there are actually many planners that will do the job with you without having charging an arm and also a leg.\\nIn case you are asking yourself how a planner can make money from you, it's because they do charge a commission. The commission is determined by the volume of income you generate.\\nInvesting is a big expenditure. You should only choose to work with a planner if you are able to afford it.

A security's duration is its amount of time before its value reaches its lowest point. The longer the duration, the higher the risk. A shorter duration is less risk, but a lower return.\\nFor example, a security that pays a fixed rate of interest every six months will have a duration of 12 months, whereas a bond that pays a fixed interest rate every six months and then matures in one year will have a duration 24 months.\\nInvestors can measure a bond's duration in one of three ways.\\nFirst, the duration of a bond can be measured by its maturity date. The longer the maturity date, the greater the risk. For example, a 10-year bond has a longer maturity date than a 3-year bond. The shorter the maturity, the lower the risk.\\nSecond, the duration of the bond can be measured in years. The longer the bond's duration, the higher its price. For example, the price of a 10.00% bond is 10 times the price of a bond that matures in   \n",

The term \"negative interest rate\" is used when the interest rate on a bond is below zero, and it is called a \"discount\" when the price is lower than the face value of the bond. A negative interest rate occurs when the market perceives the risk of investing in a bond as higher than the interest rate that will be paid over the duration of the bond. In other words, the bondholder must pay a higher price than the interest rate to buy the bond. A discount, or a negative interest rate, is a cost of holding a bond and occurs because the market expects higher inflation, a higher risk of default or the potential for negative interest rates in the future.\\nA negative interest or discount rate is a cost of investing in bonds that occur because of higher market risks.

If your broker goes out of business, you may lose access to your account and all of your stocks. However, your broker may hold your stocks as part of a custodial account for you. In such a case, the stocks are safe and you can contact your broker to get the stocks.\\nThe question was asked about \"what happens to my stock when the broker goes bankrutp.\"\\nIt's a question about the legal status of the stock in the broker's custody account.\\nIf a broker is unable to operate as a broker because it goes bankrupt, your stocks in its custodial account may be at risk. The broker is still responsible for safeguarding your investments, however. The broker will send a notification to the investors and the custodian (usually a bank) will be responsible for distributing your stocks in an orderly manner.\\nThe question asked was:\\nWhat happens to the stock   \n",

My friend says that it's because my company has grown a lot. What's your take on it?\\nWhat's your take?\\nThe P/E ratio is one of the most important tools for analyzing a company's stock. It tells you the price that you're paying for a company's share of earnings. The higher the P/E ratio, the more expensive the stock is likely to be.\\nThe P/B ratio is also important. It tells you how much a company is worth when it's bought out. If you buy a company, you'll have to pay more than the P/E because you'll have bought a company with no earnings. If you buy the company at a high P/B ratio, you're pay too much.\\nThe PEG ratio is also important, but it's not as important as the other two. The PEG ratio is a way to compare a company's price to the earnings growth. If a company has a high PEG ratio, it means that it's cheap.\\nIf you're looking to buy a company   \n",

They're entitled to the proceeds if you were to sell your shares and take that money out of the account, as it's in their name. You're also entitled to a commission from your brokerage, and that commission would be deducted from the amount you sold the shares for.\\nSchwab may also have a fee for selling the short position in the name of the brokerage. They may be able to charge you a fee if you sold the short position for less than the price of the shares, and the difference of the sale price is greater than the cost of the short position. They may also charge you a fee for sourcing a buyer for the short position. If they're charging you for those things, you'll probably see the charges on your monthly statement.\\nReply to the thread titled \"Sch   \n",

The open price is the price at which the bar opened and the close price is the price which the bar closed. The height of the candle indicates the price movement of the bar. A bullish candle indicates an increase in the price, while a bearish candle indicates a decrease in the price. The wicks at the top and the bottom of the candle indicate the highest and lowest prices respectively, and therefore, the wick that is closest to the candle's closing price is the low price of the candle.\\nA bullish candlestick indicates an increase in price. For example, if the close price is $35.75 and the open price is $36.50, then the close price is higher than the open price. This is because the close price is equal to the high price. Therefore, a bullish candles shows an increase in price after an upward trend. A bull candle also shows an increase in volume.\\n   \n",

The stock market offers an excellent opportunity to grow wealth. However, inflation can erode that wealth if it is not properly managed. When inflation is high, it is important to avoid stocks that will be impacted negatively by inflation. A good investment strategy during inflation is to invest in dividend-paying stocks.\\nThere are a variety of reasons to invest in dividends, but a few of the most important are to increase your after-tax income and to protect against inflation. When investing in dividends, it is important that you invest in companies that have a history of paying dividends. Companies that have paid dividends for many years are more likely to continue paying dividends in the future.\\nDividends are an important part of any investment strategy. Investing in dividend-producing stocks is an excellent way to grow your wealth and protect against inflation and other economic downturns.

The second reason is that the ADRs are issued to the foreigners. If the ADRs have a low market capitalization, then the foreigners will sell their stocks and buy ADRs in the market.

For instance, the transaction is done with a legal banking license. On the other side, illegal currency exchange is not done with the help of a bank.

The tax code has specific rules for short-term rentals. For example, you may be able to deduct your expenses, including mortgage interest and depreciation. You should also look into how your locality treats short-term renters. If you're renting out your entire unit for short-term, you're probably going to want to take a look at your state's income tax laws, too.\\nShort-term rentals are becoming increasingly popular. However, it's important to remember that there are specific tax implications associated with these types of rentals.\\nOne of the most important things to remember when you're rent out a unit is that you need to deduct your mortgage interest, property taxes, and maintenance costs. If you rent out your whole house, then you may also be able to deduc t depreciation on the home.

In fact, the derivative market can sometimes provide misleading information about the economy. For example, when the economy slows, the market tends to anticipate the slowdown, and the prices of the financial instruments in the market reflect that. As a result, the price of derivatives may become more expensive when the economy slowdowns, and the counterparty is exposed to a potential risk.\\nA default on a derivative trade occurs when a counterparty fails to make payments on a contract at the end of a specified period. The counterparty has breached its contract with the buyer and the seller of the contract. When this happens, the seller can either demand the buyer make up the difference between the contract price and the market price, or the seller can sue the buyer in court for the difference between the two prices.\\nWhile the seller can choose to sue the buyer, most derivatives contracts are not written so that the seller can demand a payment from the buyer.

If you want to get your own business, then you need to invest a lot of money and you need to choose the right company. It can be difficult to choose the right one, but it's important to have a good understanding of the different types of investment and how to use it. There are several investments, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and others, and each one has its own benefits and drawbacks.\\nThe first thing to consider is whether you want to invest in a stock or a bond. If you choose stocks, you can choose to buy and sell stocks at any time. However, there is a risk that the price will fall, which means you will lose money. If you choose bonds, you can only buy and sell bonds once a month. However, if you buy bonds, you will receive a monthly payment for the rest of your life.\\nAnother thing to consider is the risk you want to take with your investment.

In a sense, money printing is a way for poor countries to borrow money at a lower interest rate and therefore allow them to develop their economies and help their citizens. Money printing, however, does have its drawbacks.\\nI believe that poor countries should be able to use the money printing policy to their advantage. Money printing allows poor countries to borrow at a lower rate. For example, the United States is able to borrow money at an extremely low interest rate compared to many other countries. The United States is able borrow money at such a low interest rate because of the fact that the U.S. government is considered to be one of the world's biggest economies. The U.S. has a huge economy which is able to sustain itself through the printing of money. Money printing helps poor countries borrow money at a low rate.\\nI believe the U.S government has an interest in encouraging poor countries to borrow and print money. This helps to keep the U.S economy going. Money printing has been used by the U.S for years to boost the economy.   \n",

In this case, since the income for the year is only Rs. 600, it is not taxable for the year under consideration. The income for the year, for which a tax is payable, can be calculated by multiplying the number of months in the year by the annual salary. Thus, the total income earned by an individual for the year would be 600 x 12 = 7200 and the income tax would be Rs. 720.   \n",

A rollover of a 40 1(k) balance into an IA or Roth IRA will not incur a tax penalty.\\nThe 401 K you choose will depend on how much you expect to make over the next few years.

If the tax basis is based solely on the number of shares granted, it may not accurately reflect the tax impact of the RSU, especially if the shares are later sold or traded. By taking into account the remaining shares after the RSU is granted, the tax basis accurately reflects the tax liability on those shares. This can help to ensure that the employee's tax burden is accurately calculated and that the employer is in compliance with tax regulations.\\n   \n",

They operate by providing liquidity to the market, meaning they buy and sell securities to meet the demands of buyers and sellers. Market makers help to stabilize prices by ensuring that there is always someone willing to buy or sell a particular security at a fair price. They also provide information to investors by offering quotes and making bids and offers in the market. Without market makers, it would be more difficult for investors to buy and sell securities and for prices to be determined.\\n   \n",

The states then remit the payments to the IRS, so the states are the ones who collect the taxes, and the states are the one who determine how much they collect. They have the same withholding as the IRS. The states do not have the power to collect from the individuals, they have the power to get the employers to withhold. So, in order for the IRS to collect the estimated taxes, the states have to agree that they want the IRS to collect. The states can decide to collect themselves, but the IRS does not collect from the individuals. So, the reason that the individuals have to pay estimated taxes for the 2nd quarter and the 3rd quarter, but not the 1st quarter, is because the 1st quarter is not due to the states.\\nSo, if the 1st quarter was due to the states, then the IRS would be collecting from the individuals, but the IRS is not collecting from the individuals.\\nWhat is a good credit score?\\nCredit scores are very important because they help you qualify for loans, they help you get the best interest rates, they help you buy a home, they help you rent a   \n",

I have $200k left on my mortgage. How do I get this amount back in cash?\\nYou can either sell the house and keep the $200k in cash, or refinance the mortgage and take out the $200k. Refinancing will come with a new interest rate, which will lower your monthly payment. However, you will have to pay closing costs to refinance, which can range from 2% to 5% of the loan amount.\\nI'm not married, but my wife has a child.

In fact, there are many factors that affect your credit score, such as credit utilization ratio, late payments, credit inquiries, and the age of credit accounts. If you use more of your credit limit than you should, it can make it harder to get a loan or credit card in the future. Late payments and credit inquiries can also hurt your credit score.

Index funds, on the other hand, provide diversification and tend to have lower costs, but they may not provide the same level of potential returns as individual stocks.\\nWhat are some strategies for managing investment risk?\\nSome strategies for managing investment risks include diversifying your portfolio, setting realistic expectations, and staying disciplined.

This can result in substantial savings over the life of the loan. However, it's important to consider the impact on the monthly budget and whether the higher payment can be comfortably sustained.\\n\\nOn the other hand, a 30-year loan offers lower monthly payments, which can provide more flexibility in the budget. This may be preferable for individuals who prioritize affordability in the short term or have other financial obligations that require additional funds.\\n\\nUltimately, the choice between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage depends on factors such as income, debt, savings, and financial goals. It's advisable to consider these factors and consult with a financial advisor to determine the most suitable mortgage term for individual circumstances.\\n   \n",

       "41                            ?\\n\\nAnswer:\\n\\nDemat/Stock Market brokers do not support Credit Card Payments for a few reasons. First, Credit Cards have a higher interest rate compared to traditional payment methods like bank transfers or cash. This means that if a broker accepts Credit Card Payments, they will have to pay more in interest charges to their Credit Card Company, which can eat into their profits.\\n\\nSecond, Credit Cards do not provide the same level of security and protection as traditional payment methods. Credit Card companies have their own fraud prevention and dispute resolution processes, which can be expensive and time-consuming for brokers. Additionally, if a client makes a fraudulent transaction using their Credit Card, the broker could be held liable for the charges.\\n\\nLastly, Credit Card Payments can create additional administrative work for brokers. They would need to process credit card payments, reconcile them with their financial records, and ensure that the correct amount is deducted from the client's account. This can be time-consuming and can potentially lead to errors if not done accurately.\\n\\nOverall, while Credit Card Payments may be convenient for clients, Demat/Stock market brokers prefer to stick to traditional payment methods to avoid the potential risks and costs associated with Credit Cards.\\n   \n",

One advantage is that if you roll your money into your current employer’s IRA, you will be subject to the maximum allowable contribution for that year, which is $13,500. The current maximum contribution is $5,500.\\nI would expect that if you were eligible to contribute to a 401(k) and your employer matched your contributions, that would be a good incentive to keep contributing to the 401(k) as well as the IRA. Another advantage is that your IRA money can continue to grow tax-deferred until you are 70½, and there are no minimum required distributions.\\nWith a 401(k), you will need to take required minimum distributions starting at age   \n",

The law of demand states that as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. In the case of greeting cards, as the price of cards increases, consumers may choose to buy fewer cards or opt for cheaper alternatives, such as sending a text message or making a phone call. \\nThe law of supply states that as the cost of producing a good or service decreases, the quantity supplied increases, and vice versa, assuming that all other factors remain constant. In the case, greeting cards, the cost of producing them may be influenced by factors such as the cost of paper, ink, and labor, as well as the cost of advertising and distribution. If these costs increase, the price of cards may also increase, leading to a decrease in the quantity supplied and an increase in demand for cheaper alternatives.\\nAnother factor that may contribute to the high cost of greeting cards is the level of competition in the market. If there are many firms producing and selling greeting cards, they may engage in price competition, driving down prices to attract customers. However, if there are few firms   \n",

So it makes sense that you should be getting more money, right?\\nWell, that's not always the case. And it's especially true when the economy is in the tank.\\nYou see, even in the best of times, employers are not eager to pay their employees more. That's because the more money they pay you, the more money they will have to spend on taxes. And in a recession, taxes are even more of a concern.\\nEmployers are also reluctant to give raises during a recession because they are worried about their bottom line. They don't want to spend more money if they don't have to.\\nBut the reality is that most people do need a raise during a recession. That's because prices are going up and wages are not keeping pace. In other words, you are actually losing money if you don't get a raise.\\nSo what should you do if you need a raise during the recession? The first step is to ask for one. Be prepared to explain why you deserve it and how it will benefit the company. And if your employer says no, don't give up. Keep pushing until you get what   \n",

The first is your current financial situation, including your income, expenses, and debt. If you have enough income to cover your monthly mortgage payments and other expenses, and if your debt-to-income ratio is manageable, then you may be a good candidate for a home purchase.\\nAnother factor to consider is your long-term financial goals. Do you plan to stay in the same area for several years, or are you planning to move soon? If you plan to stay for several years, then a home purchase may be a good investment. However, if you are planning to move soon, then it may not make sense to invest in a home.\\nFinally, you should consider the current state of the housing market and interest rates. If interest rates are low and the housing market is stable, then it may be a good time to purchase a home. However, if interest rates are high or the housing market is volatile, then it may make more sense to rent.\\nIn summary, buying a home is a major financial commitment, and it's important to carefully consider your current financial situation and long-term goals before making a decision.\\n   \n",

One aspect that needs to be considered is the time it takes for money to reach its destination. In the case of international money transfer, it can take up to seven days for the funds to reach the intended recipient.\\n\\nThere are several factors that contribute to this delay. Firstly, there are transaction costs involved in the transfer process. These costs vary depending on the bank and the destination country. In addition, there are currency exchange fees that need to be considered. These fees can significantly impact the overall cost of the transfer.\\n\\nAnother factor that affects the time it takes to transfer money is the availability of funds in the recipient's account. If the recipient's account is currently empty or has insufficient funds, the transfer may be declined. In such cases, the sender will have to wait until the recipient's account has sufficient funds to complete the transfer.\\n   \n",

Inflation occurs when there is an increase in the overall price level of goods and services in an economy. When a country prints more money, there is more money in circulation, which can lead to an increase in demand for goods and services. If the supply of goods and services does not increase to match this demand, prices will rise, and the value of the currency will decrease. This can make imports more expensive, leading to a further increase in prices, and can also reduce the purchasing power of the local currency.\\n\\nAdditionally, printing more money can lead to a loss of confidence in the country's currency. Investors may lose faith in the value of the local currency, which can lead them to withdraw their investments and move their money to other countries. This can lead to a further decline in the value of currency and can exacerbate economic problems.\\n\\nIn summary, while printing more money may provide short-term relief, it can lead to long-term economic problems such as inflation, loss of confidence in currency, and a decline in the value and purchasing power of the currency.

One way is to use a tax-advantaged account such as a 401(k) or IRA. These accounts allow your savings to grow tax-deferred or tax-free, depending on the type of account. Another way is to use tax-loss harvesting, which involves selling investments that have declined in value and using the losses to offset gains on other investments. This can help reduce your overall tax liability. Additionally, you can consider using tax-free savings accounts such as 529 plans or Roth IRAs to save for specific expenses, such as education or retirement.

One important factor is the time remaining until the expiration date of the option. If there is a long time until expiration, the stock is more likely to be in the money, as it has a higher chance of reaching the strike price. On the other hand, if the time until expiration is short, the stock is less likely to be in or out of the money.\\n\\nAnother factor to consider is the volatility of the underlying stock. Higher volatility generally increases the likelihood of the stock being in themoney. This is because higher volatility means there is a greater chance of the stock moving closer to the strike price.\\n\\nAdditionally, the strike price of the option also plays a role in determining whether the stock is in the money or expiring in theMoney. If the stock is trading at or near the strike price, it is more likely to stay in the money.

A dividend is the amount of money that a company pays to its shareholders out of its earnings, and is usually distributed at the end of the year.\\nA mutual fund that invests in stocks, bonds, and other assets will receive dividends from those investments. The dividend will be paid out to the shareholders of the mutual fund, and it is up to the fund manager to decide how to invest the money received from the dividends. If the fund invests in stocks, the dividend will be reinvested in more stocks. If the fund is invested in bonds, the dividend will go towards paying interest on the bonds. If the fund has a high dividend yield, it will be able to pay out more dividends to its shareholders.   \n",

The topic of interest was the economics of greeting cards, which he says is a surprisingly profitable business. \\nThe question is this: why do they cost so much? Are they worth it? \\nThe answer may lie in the fact that they are a form of luxury good. They are expensive and people want to give them to people they care about, so they are willing to pay a higher price for them. However, they may not be as valuable as other luxury goods, such as cars or jewelry, because they are not as necessary or useful in everyday life. \\nIn any case, it is an interesting topic to think about, and one that is sure to provoke some interesting discussions. \\nA friend asked me what the best way to go about this question. I think it would be best to first try to understand the topic itself, and then to try to answer the question.

I need to transfer 2000 pounds to India. I don't have a bank account over there, but I can provide all my bank statements from the UK for the last 5 years. Can I use Moneygram to send the money? What are the charges for this transfer? Is there any way I can save money? Is it better to transfer this money through Western Union? Please advise.\\n\\nRegards,\\nRaj\\n\\nHi there!\\nThanks for your question!\\n\\nYes, Moneygram is a great service to use.

I'm sure there are some other threads on this but not a lot of detail. If it's just a conversion of one currency to another, it can be done with excel and a few formulas. If it'll be a conversion of one bank statement to another, I'm afraid it won't be possible. You'd need to know all the transactions that were in the bank statement. It would be impossible to find the transactions that were on the other bank statement.\\n\\nThere are a lot of good spreadsheet programs out there. If you're looking to convert a bunch of statements, maybe the best option is to buy one of the good spreadsheet programs and use it.\\nWhat do you mean by \"another currency\"?\\nI meant the exchange rate.\\nIn order to convert the bank statement, you need to know the rate between the two currencies. If you've got the rates from the two banks, then you can use excel to do the conversion.\\nI'm not sure if that's possible with Excel, though. If you want to be sure that it will be possible, then you need to know exactly what the two banks are going to use.   \n",

What is the implication?\\n\\nFor example, if I buy a stock at 100, and it goes to 105 after the ex-dividend date. But then the ex-date comes, and the company decides to pay a dividend of 5%, so the price is 105 * 1.05 = 109.25.\\n\\nThen, the dividend will be received after the ex- date, so it is 109 * 1.1125 = 119.5625, which means that after the dividend payment, the price is 219.575 - 5 = 214.575.\\n\\nHowever, if the company decides to do a stock split after the ex- dividend date, then it will be split to 2 shares, so the price will be 100 / 2 = 50, and the dividend is still 5% of 50 = 2.5.\\n\\nHowever the price will be split to the number of shares, so 50 / 2= 25, and the price will still be 109   \n",

This means that if the investment was sold within one year, the proceeds from the sale would be considered taxable income.\\n\\nStep 2/2\\nIn this case, the transfer would be considered taxable because it is not held for more than a year. The transfer would be exempt from taxation if the investment was maintained for more than one tax year. However, the exact tax treatment depends on the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the amount of the investment, the tax status of the individual making the transfer, and the tax laws of both the United States and India.   \n",

This helped me to avoid the freezing issue and my project continued to run smoothly.\\n\\nReply + 1:\\n\\nDear Student,\\n\\nI think the issue with my financial information is related to data quality. The financial information provided by some sources may not be accurate or complete. I would suggest checking the data quality and making sure that it is complete and free of errors. Additionally, try to identify any outliers or anomalies in the data that could affect the accuracy of your analysis.\\n\\nReply - 1:\\n\\nHello [Your Name], \\n\\nI had a similar problem when working on a project related to financial information.

The tax is also based on the amount of remaining shares after each share is sold, which is calculated as the difference between the business's revenue divided by the number of shares sold. The business's revenue remains constant, so the tax is always paid with the same amount of shares sold.\\nTo summarize, RSU tax is based on revenue, profit, and shares remaining after shares are withed, and the tax rate is fixed at 10%.

Enjoy your journey!\"\\n\\nReply 2:\\n\\n\"I had a similar problem when I was working on a project that involved analyzing financial data. One of the solutions that helped was to use machine learning algorithms to predict financial outcomes based on historical data. This approach can be more accurate and scalable than traditional statistical analysis. Additionally, there are many resources available for learning machine learning, including online tutorials and courses. Good luck!\"\\n\\nReply 3:\\n\\n\"Another approach to solving this problem is to use fuzzy logic. This approach uses fuzzy logic rules to represent financial instruments and their interactions. This can make it easier to analyze and make informed decisions based on the input financial data. Additionally, there is a Python library called 'pyfuz' that can be used to implement fuzzy logic algorithms. Try using it!\"\\n\\nReply 4:\\n\\n\"You can also try using crowdsourcing algorithms to solve this problem. Crowdsourcing algorithms involve simulating real-world scenarios and predicting financial outcomes based on those scenarios. This approach can help you overcome the limitations of traditional statistical   \n",

If I am accepted for a job after graduation, will I have to repay the loan or can I use it for living expenses or other purposes?\\nYou are right that a personal loan may be the best choice for you if you are graduating with a degree in computer science and are interested in pursuing a graduate program in a similar field. You can use the money you borrow to pay for your graduate studies, but you will still have to pay the interest while you are in school.\\nThere are several things you can do to reduce the interest you pay on your loan.

This is because the shares are withheld for tax purposes to avoid double taxation, which would happen if the shares were taxed at the rate of the company in which the shares are held. The RSUs would be taxed at the lower rate if held in a personal account, but would be taxed on the company where the shares are held if held in a company-owned retirement plan.\\nCan RSUs be held in a company's stock fund?\\nYes, but you will need to have an account with a brokerage firm or mutual fund dealer to hold your RSUs. In general, it is recommended that you keep your RSUs in your personal account, or in a retirement plan, such as a 401(k) plan. If you hold RSUs in a brokerage account, the brokerage firm charges a commission for each transaction.\\nDoes an RSU have to be exercised before it can be sold?\\nNo, an RSU has no time limit.

       "76                      \\nExchange rates are the price of one currency at a given time relative to another. Exchange rates are influenced by political and economic events, such as a war or an economic recession. Exchange rates change almost every day due to many factors, including a government's policies, economic conditions, and the demand for a currency. For example, the United States has a very large economy and is the world's largest exporter. This means that it is the most important trading partner of many other countries. This means that the value of the dollar is likely to be affected by the economic conditions of these other countries. Similarly, if a country has a large amount of foreign currency, it is likely to have a stronger economy and a weaker dollar. In addition, a country with a strong dollar is likely also to be an oil exporter, which means that the value may be affected by the price of oil.\\nIn addition, a country's economic policies can affect its exchange rates. For example, a country with high taxes on income or capital may have a weaker dollary, while a country with low taxes may have a stronger dollary. Similarly, a country with an economy that is heavily   \n",

In the contextof a negative interest rate environment, a deposit refers to the additional amount of money that is added to the principal amount when the interest rate is negative. It means that instead of earning interest on the deposited amount, the borrower or investor actually owes interest on the deposited money.

The inspector finds several issues with the houses they are considering, such as water damage, foundation problems, and faulty electrical wiring. Sarah and Tom decide not to make an offer on any of the houses that they find out have serious issues. They continue their search, and eventually, they find a house that they love.

Today, I want to discuss the concepts of bravery and fearfulness, and how they relate to our daily lives. In our world, these traits are often used to describe how people respond to challenges and risks.\\n\\nBravery is the ability to face and overcome fear, even in difficult situations. It is like a sturdy roof that protects us from the rain and storms of life. When we are brave, we take risks, try new things, and face our fears head-on. This allows us to grow and learn from our experiences.\\n\\nOn the other hand, fearfulness is the opposite of bravery. It is like being trapped in a cage, unable to move forward or explore new opportunities. When we are fearful, we avoid taking risks and often let our fears control our actions. This can limit our potential and prevent us from experiencing new things.\\n\\nTo better understand these concepts, let's relate them to the sentence you mentioned about making a pie crust. Imagine you are a baker trying to make a pie crust from scratch. Being brave would mean trying  \n",

Market makers play a crucial role in facilitating the buying and selling of stocks in the market. Let's explore the importance of market makers and how they operate in the trading process.\\n\\nMarket makers are entities, such as large financial institutions or exchanges, that act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers of a particular stock. They play a key role in ensuring a smooth flow of transactions in the market. By providing liquidity and acting as a matchmaker, market makers enable investors to access the stock market and buy or sell shares at the best possible price.\\n\\nThe primary function of market makers is to create an efficient market by matching buyers and sellers. They have access to the entire market and can easily determine the current price of a stock. Market makers set the bid and ask prices, which are the minimum and maximum prices at which a stock can be traded. These prices are crucial for ensuring a fair and orderly trading environment.\\n\\nTo better understand the role of marketmakers, let's consider an example. Imagine you want to buy shares of a popular technology company. However, the price of the shares is higher than what you can afford. Without  \n",

Estimating taxes early ensures that you have enough funds to cover your tax obligations throughout the year. By doing so, you can avoid any financial difficulties or penalties that may arise from late or inaccurate tax payments.\\n\\nWhat are the factors that can affect your estimated tax liability?\\nThere are several factors that can influence your estimated tax liability. These include your taxable income, deductions, credits, and other relevant information. It is important to consider these factors when estimating your tax liability to ensure accuracy and avoid any potential issues with the IRS.\\n\\nWhy do you have to make a payment of estimated taxes?\\nEstimated taxes are required because the IRS needs a general idea of your annual income, regardless of when you actually pay your taxes. By making estimated tax payments, you are meeting your tax obligations and ensuring compliance with the law.\\n\\nWhy are estimated tax payments due by April 15, 2011?\\nThe deadline for making estimated tax payments is April 15, 2011, to account for the current tax year. By meeting this deadline, you are fulfilling your tax liability for the current year and avoiding any potential penalties or interest charges.\\n\\nWhy don't you have  \n",

Now, let's explore the potential risks associated with buying a house for your friend and selling it back to him.\\n\\n1. What's my risk of not having enough money for a down payment?\\nAnswer: Not having enough money for the down payment can be risky because it may limit the seller's ability to purchase the house outright. It can also result in a higher interest rate if the seller opts for a mortgage, which could impact the overall cost of the home.\\n\\n2. What's my concern about the seller's ability and willingness to buy the house?\\nAnswer: The seller's ability and desire to buy the house directly impact the success of the transaction. If the seller is unsure or hesitant, it can lead to complications and delays. It's important to ensure that both parties are on the same page regarding their intentions and commitment to the deal.\\n\\n3. What's my worry about my friend's financial stability?\\n  \n",

The answer is yes, one does have to keep stock to receive the dividend payment until the payment date.\\n\\nDividend payments are usually made quarterly, but the frequency may vary depending on the specific stock and company. When a company pays dividends, it does so by distributing a portion of its earnings to its shareholders in the form of cash.\\n\\nTo ensure the smooth flow of dividend payments, it is often necessary to hold a certain amount of stock. This stock is known as stock position or holding. By holding stock, investors can benefit from the dividends even if they are not paid until a later date.\\n\\nStock position can be established by investing in the company's shares. By purchasing stock, investors become partial owners of the company and have the right to receive dividends and other financial benefits. Holding stock allows investors to benefit from the company's earnings over time, even if they are paid after the payment date.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce upon a time, there was a small town called Greenfield.

As a financial advisor, I can provide you with a detailed response to your question.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, it's important to understand that credit card companies are primarily concerned with the revenue generated from credit card transactions. When you pay your credit card bill, the credit card company typically receives a percentage of the total amount you owe. This revenue is then reinvested into the company, which may lead to higher interest rates and fees for you as the cardholder.\\n\\nCredit card companies often partner with banks or payment processors to offer services such as cashback rewards or other incentives. While these partnerships may seem beneficial to you as a cardholder, they are primarily aimed at maximizing the company's profits. Therefore, credit card companies may not fully support or encourage the idea of using credit cards for everyday expenses like paying for gas or groceries.\\n\\nMoreover, credit card companies have to comply with various regulations and guidelines to ensure the security and safety of your financial information. While they do take steps to protect your data, it's important for you to be aware that your credit card information is still vulnerable to fraud  \n",

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allows for individuals to contribute a certain amount of money each year to a retirement savings account called an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). However, it's important to understand the specific rules and limits regarding how much can be contributed.\\n\\n2. To contribute to an IRA, the amount of money you can put in is based on your income and tax bracket. The IRS sets a cap on how much an individual can contribute to their IRA in a year.\\n\\n3. The IRA cap for 2014 is $5,500. This means that individuals can contribute a maximum of $5,500 per year towards their IRA.\\n\\n4. It's important to note that if you earn more than the limit set by the IRS, you may have to pay taxes on the excess contribution. However, there are some exceptions to this rule.\\n\\n5. For example, if you're self-employed or have earned income from a business, you may be eligible for a larger IRA contribution limit. Additionally, if you're over 50 years old, you may be able to contribute an extra $1,000 per year.\\n\\n6. If you have an employer-sponsored retirement plan  \n",

I'm glad you found my answers helpful. To answer your first question, it depends on your current financial situation and long-term goals. If you have a stable job, it may be wise to prioritize saving and investing for your future. However, if you have some extra funds and are willing to take calculated risks, buying a house can be a good investment.\\n\\nIn terms of investing, both stocks and bonds have their advantages and disadvantages. Stocks offer the potential for higher returns but also come with greater risks. Bonds, on the other hand, provide more stability and are generally considered lower-risk investments. It's important to consider your risk tolerance and financial goals when deciding between stocks and bonds.\\n\\nRegarding starting a business or continuing working for someone else, there are pros and cons to both options. Starting a business can offer you the opportunity to be your own boss, have control over your career, and potentially earn higher income. However  \n",

Taxes play a crucial role in funding public services and infrastructure, but they can also have a significant impact on individuals and businesses.\\n\\nFirstly, let's talk about the positive side of taxes. Taxes help fund public services such as healthcare, education, and transportation. These services are essential for the well-being of our society and ensure that everyone has access to basic necessities. Without taxes, these services would not be possible, and the quality of life for individuals and communities would be greatly affected.\\n\\nAdditionally, taxes also contribute to the overall economic growth and stability of a country. By providing the necessary funds for public goods and services, taxes stimulate economic activity and create job opportunities. This, in turn, leads to a higher standard of living and improved living conditions for all.\\n\\nOn the negative side, taxes can sometimes be a burden for individuals and businesses. High tax rates can reduce people's disposable income, making it harder for them to meet their financial obligations. This can lead to financial stress and hardship  \n",

If the market perceives an ADR as a good investment opportunity, the price may increase.

Companies with a well-defined and efficient ADR strategy, which includes effective marketing, robust operations, and a strong customer base, are more likely to attract investors and achieve positive returns.

I believe that facilitating currency exchange between a private account and a bank for foreign residents is a legal and safe process. Private banks are regulated by government bodies and have strict guidelines to ensure the security and integrity of their transactions. Additionally, banks have the necessary infrastructure and technology to handle currency conversions accurately. Furthermore, the exchange rate offered by private banks is usually competitive and offers a better value for foreign residents compared to the banks' rates. Therefore, facilitating currency exchange between these accounts is a beneficial service for foreign residents. \\n\\n2. While I understand the benefits of facilitating currency exchange, I believe it is not a legal process. Private banks, unlike banks, are not subject to the same regulations and oversight by government bodies. This lack of regulation increases the risk of fraud and illegal activities. Moreover, private banks may not have the necessary resources and infrastructure to handle large volumes of currency conversions efficiently. As a result, there is a higher chance of errors and discrepancies in the exchange rates offered by private banks. Therefore, facilitating such currency exchange should be strictly regulated to protect the interests of foreign residents. \\n\\n\\n\\n(13).

However, the truth is that it would only make things worse. Printing more money would increase inflation, making goods and services more expensive. This would lead to a decrease in the purchasing power of the poor.\\nSo, what can they do instead?\\nWell, one option is for the government to implement austerity measures. This means cutting down on government spending and reducing the budget deficit. It may be a difficult decision, but it is necessary for the long-term health of the economy.\\nAnother option is for the countries to increase their exports. By focusing on selling their products to other countries, they can generate more revenue and reduce their dependence on imports.\\nBut what if those options don't work?\\nIn that case, the countries may need to seek assistance from international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank. They can provide financial aid and expertise to help them overcome their economic challenges.\\nHowever, it's important to note that relying on external aid can also have its drawbacks. It can create a cycle of dependency and prevent countries from developing their own economic capabilities.\\nSo, in conclusion, there are several strategies  \n",

The main reason is that there are several economic factors that affect the value of a currency. For example, changes in inflation rates, interest rates, and foreign investment can all affect the value of the currency. In addition, political events, such as elections or natural disasters, can also impact the exchange rate. These factors all work together to determine the value of a country's money.\\n\\nReply 2:\\nThe exchange rates of a currency change because of supply and demand. The currency that is in high demand is worth more than the currency that is in low demand. This is because when there is a high demand for a currency, the value of that currency goes up, and vice versa. This is similar to how the value of stocks goes up or down depending on supply and demand.\\n\\nReply 3:\\nThe exchange of currencies happens because of the international financial system. Countries trade goods and services with each other, and they use different currencies to do so. When a country wants to buy something from another country, they need to exchange their currency for the currency of the country they are buying from. This is done through banks, exchange offices  \n",

It ensures that financial transactions are recorded and reported based on the date they occurred, regardless of when cash is received or paid. This method allows individuals to better manage their income, expenses, and savings, providing them with a clearer picture of their financial health.\\n\\nQuestion: Can you provide an example of how the accrual accounting method can be used in personal banking?\\n\\nAnswer (Positive Side): Let's say you receive a monthly salary of $2,000. Instead of waiting for the money to be deposited into your bank account, you decide to record the income as soon as it is received. Using the accrual basis of accounting, you would record the $2,000 in your financial statements as income for the current month.

A diversified portfolio can help to minimize risk, reduce losses, and increase returns over time.

I wanted to share my thoughts on the recent developments in Argentina and the South Korean banks' situation.\\n\\nFrom what I have gathered, it appears that the banks in Argentina have faced a significant challenge due to the ongoing crisis.

We will also discuss the benefits of paying down a mortgage early and the factors that contribute to this decision. By the end of this section, you will have a better understanding of how mortgages can be viewed as a long-term investment and the potential advantages of paying them off sooner rather than later.\\n\\nWhat are mortgages and why do people have them?\\n\\nMortgages are loans that individuals or families take out to purchase a property. They are typically used to buy a house, an apartment, or other types of real estate. Mortgages allow people to become homeowners without having to pay the full purchase price upfront. Instead, they borrow money from a bank or lender and make monthly payments to repay the loan over time.\\n\\nPeople take out mortgages for various reasons. Some may want to build equity in their homes by making regular mortgage payments, while others may be looking to invest in a property that has the potential to appreciate in value over time. Additionally, mortgages provide individuals with a sense of security and stability, as they can rely on their homes as a source of income and as an investment.\\n\\nCan\n",
       "1                                Answer: Yes, by paying down your mortgage, you are increasing the equity in your home and building equity that will appreciate over time. \\n\\nHow can I increase the equity in my home by paying down my mortgage? Answer: By paying down your mortgage every month, you are reducing the balance owed on your loan and increasing your equity. This is because the equity is the difference between the market value of your home and the amount owed on the mortgage.\\n\\nWhat is the impact of paying down a mortgage on my credit score? Answer: Paying down a mortgage can have a positive impact on your credit score. This is because reducing your debt and making timely mortgage payments can demonstrate responsible financial behavior to lenders, which can lead to an improved credit score.\\n\\nCan I still qualify for a mortgage if I am paying down my current mortgage? Answer: Yes. As long as you continue to make timely mortgage payments, lenders will view you as a low-risk borrower and may still approve your application. However, it's important to be transparent about your mortgage-related expenses to avoid any potential issues with your credit report.\\n\\nWhat are some potential drawbacks of paying down a student loan while making mortgage payments? Answer: One potential drawback\n",
       "2             \\nAnswer: Yes, paying down a mortgage can be considered an investment because it allows you to build equity in your home. When you pay off a mortgage, you are effectively increasing the value of your property, which can be a valuable asset in the long run. Additionally, paying down a large portion of your mortgage can improve your credit score and financial stability, making you more likely to qualify for better interest rates in the future.\\n\\nWhat is the most common reason people choose to pay off their mortgage early?\\nAnswer: The most common reason people chose to pay off their mortgages early is to save money on interest. By paying off your mortgage before the end of the term, you can avoid paying interest on the remaining balance for several years. This can result in significant savings over time, especially if you have a large balance or high-interest rate.\\n\\nCan paying off your mortgage early have any negative consequences?\\nAnswer: While paying off your mortgage can have many benefits, there are a few potential negative consequences to consider. One potential consequence is that paying off your mortgage too quickly can reduce the amount of equity you have in your home. Equity is the difference between the current value of your home and the amount still owed on your\n",
