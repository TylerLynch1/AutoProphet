I did find a few on Yelp that said they were a great experience, but they were mostly negative.  There is nothing wrong with using the software, but you have to consider the time spent, and the fact that you are not in the same state at the same time.  This is a good way to waste money.  You can find plenty of good ones at taxes.com, but I did not think they were that great.  I think it depends on your situation, but I'd recommend you talk to someone.\n",

      " Answer:  I think you are conflating the concept of loss and the concept of investing.  For some people, investing is akin to buying stocks in the hope that they will go up, or even buy some kind of stock or bond fund to invest in.  Some people, like myself, have a lot of investment savings that we use for our day to day expenses.  In the case of the 1% stock, it is still a small amount that we put into the market.   There is some research that shows that people who do not have the necessary amount of money to invest in the stock market have higher returns than people who invest in the stocks.  In the end, it is up to you, if you want to put money into the stock market or not.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  A good starting point is \"Forex Basics\". I've always had a good understanding of how the exchange system works and why it is different from other currencies. I've been trading since 2003, and I've used all the resources offered by my broker (BNP Paribas). I've found the following to be helpful: 1) \"A Guide to Forex\" is a good place to start. The section on foreign exchange trading was very helpful to me. I was able to get a pretty good idea of how to do it and where to start. It was a good starting point. I found that it was very hard to find a currency to trade with. I found my first foreign exchange was through a stock brokerage account. That is the most important step for most people. I did my research and decided to go with FX.com and use the FX.com Stock Market. 2) \"Forex Trading Basics\" is a good introduction. The section on trading forex is a good starting point and it's pretty easy to get an idea of what you're doing.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  The usual answer is 30% if you're making more than $400k/year, 20% if you make more than $30k/year. I would say that you could probably get a better deal if you paid your rent at the market price, but I'd say that is not practical. I know that in the US, that it is common for the rent to be $150/mo if the tenant is under 30. I've had good tenants, but I've never had one under 30 years old.\n",

He had to get out of the house before the 20% loan kicks in, and was forced to move his parents in.  That said, the money saved in the long run is still better than 20%, but it's a bit more hassle to deal with.\n",

      " Answer:  Yes you can.  The most basic way is by paying for the annual credit report.  If you pay $99 for your annual report and it comes out negative then you have a low credit score.  If you get your report from one of the 3 major bureaus, and pay $99, and it comes out positive, you have a high credit score.  And if you have a positive credit score, your annual report will be free to you.\n",

      "what is difference between stock and dividend?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  The stock price is just the value of the company, which is what you are buying at the time.  The dividend is a cash dividend from the company. The dividend is paid to shareholders. If you bought at $10, and the company announced they will pay $1 per share, that's a $1 dividend.  If the stock price is $10, the dividend is $10 per share. If the stock price was $10, that's just $1 per share.  This doesn't mean that stock price doesn't fluctuate, it just means that you can't buy more shares, or sell more shares, to get a larger dividend. If you have 100 shares of the company, and $1 per share is the dividend, you can buy 100 more shares for $10 per additional share, and then sell them for $1 per additional share. The dividend isn't guaranteed.  In many cases, the dividend isn'ts even guaranteed.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  There are two common investment options, and I believe you can choose the right one. If you don't want to go through the hassle, you can invest with just a debit card.  I know you are thinking of the US dollar but the world can be different.  I've heard of people using Canadian Dollars as a place to put their money.  You could also try a foreign exchange account.  I think you would be surprised how many of us actually trade with money outside of our own country.  If you don' know a lot about trading, try the USD account.  The USD is pretty much the same.  You can trade foreign currencies.  You can even get a lot of exposure to international markets by opening an account with a broker.  Some brokerage firms have programs that let you trade with them.  Some brokers will let you trade with any broker they have.  They will even let you trade with their own broker.  You could try a free trading account with them.

      "How is not paying off mortgage better in normal circumstances?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  I would say that paying off the loan is better in normal circumstances because it reduces the risk of default and reduces the likelihood of the borrower defaulting on the loan. It is also more difficult for the borrower to foreclose on the loan if they have no other liens on the property. The borrower can also pay the loan off early or reduce the rate on the loan. In other words, the borrower has the option of paying the loan off sooner. This reduces the risk of the borrowee defaulting on the mortgage and reduces the likeliness of the borrobee defaulting on it. I would say the risk of default is not really a factor when paying the loan. Paying off the loan early is more likely to happen in extreme situations when the borrower doesn't have other liens on his property.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I am surprised that there is no general answer to your question. If you can't find a single solution online, I suggest you to talk to a solicitor. They will help you to determine the legal requirements and you will be given a solution that you can accept. The main thing you need to be aware of is that you are not obliged to have the company pay you a percentage of the income that is earned by the company. You are still paying into the pension. You can request from your company that you are paid a percentage of your income into the pension but they will not be obliged to pay you that amount. I am not aware of any legislation that makes it mandatory for a company to pay you a percentage into the pension, but I am sure that the pension is required to have an income element that is sufficient to meet the legal requirements. If the company does not have the income to pay you a percent of your salary then you can ask your company to pay you in full. I think you can expect a fee of around £100 to £200. The fee is based on your annual salary and the amount of your salary that is paid into the pension\n",

If you're a bit worried about taxes, then a Roth ISA might be a good idea, as they're not taxed at all. If you'd rather not put all your money into one place, then a regular ISA would be your best bet. If you want to have different accounts in different banks, then it's a bit trickier, as they don't need to be in the same bank, and can be more complicated to manage, as you might need to be able to move money around and do various things in different places. You could look at some of the options that are mentioned above.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I would say that the answer to this question depends on your age. If you are 21 and in college, you are not likely to have much money in a retirement account. If you are in the 40 year old bracket and are young, you may be able to invest in a Roth 401K.  The 401(k) and IRA are separate accounts. You can open an IRA with no minimum balance and can contribute up to $5500 to the IRA.  If you have a job and are making enough to contribute the $550/year to your IRA, you should open a Roth 457 account.  This will be the account that you will be working at the time you make the deposit into. The 457 is the account that will earn you the maximum $550. The 40 year account is the account that you open with the $5550. You will have to open another IRA with the money from that account.  This is where you are likely to see higher returns.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I have heard that you can get better performance by investing in the market, not your portfolio. I have seen the numbers for the S&P500 Index over the last 100 years (from the first year) and the numbers are pretty close.  The index has returned 9.59% in the last 17 years. If you invest in the S&P you get the same returns as if you invest in a fund. So if you invest in your portfolio you will get a higher return. I think you have to look at the performance over the last 50 years and look at the numbers and decide if you want to buy into the S&P or the index.  I've done some of my own research into the S&p 500 index and I have decided that it is a good idea to diversify into different stocks. So I bought some Vanguard index funds in 2000 and 2005.

The price increase per unit is usually calculated based on inflation rates from the past.  There are a number of factors to consider including the currency of the economy.  It can be more difficult to understand the inflation rate as it is based on an average year.  I suggest that you try to look at the inflation rate in a longer time frame to get a more meaningful number.  The best way to understand the inflate rate is to use the chart of the average inflation rate.  That should give you a good idea of how inflation rates are calculated.\n",

You will sell a short position of the AMD stock on your behalf to someone else and you will get your short position back.  Your broker may be able to give you some more information.  If you don't see it in the prospectus you should check with your broker.  If the stock doesn't look like the price you want to buy the stock at you will want to be sure that you will get what you want for the price you want.  I think you will have to go through your broker and get the details of what you want to do.

      " Answer:  As others have pointed out, the ETF is very close to the underlying index. This means that there are some things you need to be careful about. First, the ETF price does not have to match the underlying. If the ETF is trading at 50 cents, then VXX will be trading at 100 cents. Second, the ETF will not always track the underlying. This is the case for the VXX ETF. Third, the ETF may be better suited to your risk profile. This is where you can use it.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I don't think there's a universal answer to this. It seems to be less about the patient's health than it is about the provider's willingness to pay. Some providers have an incentive to try to get paid by insurers (which is why some of them do this) and some of them have no incentive to pay. The question is: does the patient value the time and effort they put in to getting paid? It depends on the provider, but I have never had to pay a provider a single dollar for a service that I didn't need. And I've been told that there are many providers who don't have incentive to do that.\n",

      "Can I buy IPO stock during the pre-market trading on the day of IPO?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  If the IPO has already closed and the market has closed, then yes, you can buy it during the market opening.  You will get your IPO shares at 12 noon ET, but the IPO opening market will close around 1:00PM ET, which is the time of day when you buy your shares.  If you are not sure when you want to buy your IPO shares, you should probably buy a stock with a pre-market trade.  Otherwise, you could probably wait until after the market closes and buy during the market opening (which is probably not very likely to be open at 12:00PM). If you're really interested in buying IPO shares during the day, the best option is to buy a company like Google or Facebook that is trading.  You can get access to a lot of IPOs, so that's probably a good idea.  Just be sure to check with your broker, who is going to be the one who handles your account and the exchange that you're going to be trading on.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  There are a few factors to consider, and you will be better off doing a little of both. Firstly, make sure you know your credit rating. You should know how much you have, and what your credit score is. You can try and get a loan from a bank or a credit union, and if you are a first time borrower, they may be able to help you out with the first couple of loans. This way you will be in control of your finances.  If you are not sure of your credit score, you can try and do some credit checks, and if you do well you can try and get credit union loans. If you have a good credit rating you can try and open a card with a good credit rating. If you have good credit rating, you can try to open a mortgage with a good credit score. It should help your credit rating.  If you do open a mortgaged, make sure you are able to make the payments on time. Also check your payments on time, if you can.  In addition, it might be worth getting a second mortgage to get a second credit card and build up a good credit history.\n",

If your investment portfolio is in one company and your goals are to invest in stocks, then you can buy stocks in that company, but you need to pick stocks that are performing well.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  Long term bonds are a bit more risky than short term bonds, because it is generally easier to make a profit from a short term bond than it is from a long term bond. Long term bonds are generally more risky than bonds with a short duration, because the short duration is more dependent on the economy of the country that issued the bond, and the bond issuer is more likely to default on the bond than the economy of the United States.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  If the bank is making money on the loan, they are making money on interest only, which means that you are making interest on the money you borrowed.  You should be worried about making interest on your loan if you are paying the loan in full every month.  That means that they are paying interest on your money.   It is a bit of a red flag that they are making money off you.  It's a bit like when you rent a car at a dealership.  They make money on the loan and the dealership makes money on the sale of the car.  You are making interest on that car and you are paying interest every month.  This is because they make money on interest only.  If you are paying your loan in full every week, they are paying you interest.   When you are paying for something that you don't have, it is always a good idea to have that money in a separate account.  It is a way to keep that money from being lost.  If you pay in full every month, they are making interest every month on that money.   If you are pay in full every week for something you don't own,\n",

I would suggest buying it at the airport in the currency of your home country, so that you can use the money in the currency you are most comfortable with.  If you can do it with USD or GBP, that's another matter altogether. I don't have any experience with the currency, but I've heard that it's pretty stable (at least for the time being).\n",

In your case, you are not a corporation.  You are a limited liability company.  This is what makes it easier for some businesses to use a tax haven.  You have a liability shield for the income.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  This is a very common practice in Canada. There are a few reasons. Most people do not understand how a bank works. They are not paying for any service. Most people do understand that a bank is paying for its business. However, they do not understand the difference between a bank and a business.  This can be the case if the bank is a local branch. The bank is paying interest on money held in a branch account. This is typically a small amount of money. Most people would not understand this. I think that a good way to explain it is to show that if you buy an item in Canada that is made in the United States, you pay for it. You pay for it in USD. You pay for this by purchasing a USD bank account. So you pay for a USD bank in Canada. If you want to keep your money, then that is your choice.\n",

There is no way to guarantee that they are not a liability on the mortgage.  The lender is in the business of collecting payments.  This means that they will want to make sure that the lender is doing everything in their power to collect the money.  This is the business of the bank.  If you can get a loan at 2% and pay back the money on time, you are not really a liability for them.  If they are worried about the liability, they might be able to do a reverse mortgage.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  You don't want to do this.  In fact, I'd say you shouldn't be doing this. You can't deduct interest expenses from your income, and if you're planning on using your loan to pay a mortgage or other debt, you're going to want to make sure you can pay it back. You're not going to get a tax deduction for the interest expense either, and you should have a hard time convincing your bank that it's a legitimate expense. I would suggest that you just use the $300 you got from the loan as a down payment on a house you plan on selling anyway.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  As others have mentioned, 401(k) or 403b.  As mentioned, a lot depends on your tax bracket.  Some people are under-taxed, some over-taxed.  In the 1970s, I saw a bunch of people with tax brackets as low as 35% or 40%.  This is the tax bracket that most people fall into.  A 25 year old with 25% tax bracket, would only be in the 35% bracket, and still have some of the tax savings from the 403(k).  A person with 40% tax bracket would only be in 35% tax brackets, but still have a good amount of tax savings from 403.  A 35% guy with a 40% bracket, might have 35% of his tax bracket in 40% income taxes, but would still have a lot of tax savings, since he only paid $3k in taxes.  A 40% guy with 35%\n",

      "Why is the breakdown of a loan repayment into principal and interest of any importance?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  It's because the amount of principal that you owe is known. It is not easy to get a loan at a 20% interest rate. If you had borrowed 20% of the value of the property at 5% interest, and had to pay it back at 12%, you would end up paying more in interest. The bank may ask you to pay them a fee to take the loan. This may make the payments more expensive. You should also take a loan calculator to see how much interest you are paying. If you pay back 20% on 12% interest loan and get a 12% loan, then you have lost 1% interest.\n",

A judge could rule that the court of law has no jurisdiction, which means that you can't even get a judgement on the debt.

      " Answer:  Stock is a financial product. The stock prices are just the price of the previous transaction. I can not make sense of the question \"How to evaluate stock?\" because you need to understand the fundamentals and the technical analysis of the stock before you can make a reasonable evaluation. For instance, if a stock price is $20, but the fundamentals are bad and the stock is just going to go down in the next few months, you are probably not going to make money, especially in a volatile stock market. The best way to evaluate stocks is to read the fundamental analysis, the technical analysis and the fundamentals.\n",

      " Answer:  Deposit your savings into a Roth 401K or IRA. The Roth 4050 is the \"lowest tax-deductible IRA\" and the IRA contribution limits are much lower than the Roth 4065. The Roth 2731 is a bit of a mixed bag. It is a traditional IRA, and it has lower limits, but it does have a bit of a tax-advantaged advantage. You can deduct a bit of your Roth 403b IRA contribution in the form of a Traditional IRA contribution. But it is still a Traditional Ira. The Roth 3895 is the \"highest tax-advantaging IRA\" and is available for deposit into a Roth IRA. I believe that you can deduct the Roth 3850, which is the Roth 4535, and also contribute to Roth 4085. The Roth IRA contribution limits may be lower than the Roth IRA contribution limit.\n",

      "Why would you ever turn down a raise in salary?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  The first reason to turn down a raise is when your salary is in excess of your monthly expenses. This is the case for most of us. If we take 50% more money from our paychecks than we make from our jobs, and we are still under the same amount, we will never be happy.  That is the second reason to turn down the raise. If you have already made a lot of money and have more than 20% left over, you should not get a raise. This is the second reason for not turning down a raise. The third reason for not turning the raise down is when you have already worked out a better deal with your employer. For example, you might want to be paid a lower amount in a different way, or you might want to get a different salary from your employer. The fourth reason for not turning a raise down is when the raise is in a way that is not reasonable. This is the fourth reason for not getting the raise. The last reason to not get a raise is when you have not been paid for 3 years, or you are already in a high tax bracket. This is the last reason for not getting a raise.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I have heard a similar answer before, but I will offer it again. It is the mortgage you will pay. It is your money. If you do the math correctly, you will end up paying more than $200k on a mortgaged home. If you pay off a $200K mortgage in 10 years, you'll be ahead of most people. That said, you can save $2000 a month, and have enough cash flow to live on.  If you are going to put money into a retirement account, put it into a Roth IRA, and pay off the mortgage. If you're going to invest the money in something that can compound over time, pay off the mortage.\n",

A few years ago I opened a Roth IRA for my child, who was a little younger, because the market was up and I wanted to have some extra money for college.  The Roth was set up to be tax-deferred, so you'd have to pay taxes, but it allowed us to invest in a variety of stocks and funds that we wanted.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I would say that the mechanism of money fluctuation is the way banks can inflate the value of their currency. This is called \"money supply inflation\".  It's when a bank prints money in order to \"buy dollars and yen\" which makes them more valuable in the future.  This is when they can print money as well. This can be seen on a daily or weekly basis in a lot of different currencies.  This is why you see the yen going up and down on the currency market.  This is called \"monetary easing\" and it's when a central bank \"buys dollars and yen from the foreign banks\" (or \"banks\") to make their currency more valuable to the foreigners.  It is used to reduce inflation which is used to make the currency more valuable to foreigners.  Money supply inflation is also used to make it more expensive to borrow money from banks in order to make their currency less valuable to foreigners, especially as the dollar is weakening against other currencies.  The other methods of money supply inflation are \"money supply easing\", \"money supply deflation\", \"\n",

      " Answer:  It sounds like the best thing you can do is wait for the next EOD high to be reached, and keep your position open until you get to it. This will take a little time and patience, but if you are patient and can stay invested in a company and not let emotions get in the way, you can get the best results possible. I don't recommend trading with your broker, and you may end up in a worse situation than you are right now if you do it. I recommend getting a third party, preferably one that you have been with for a while, and trusting them.\n",

      "On claiming mileage and home office deductions\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  Yes, you can do that. It depends on whether you're doing this for the IRS or the tax credits.  The tax credit is for taxpayers, which are people who: (a) are claiming income on a Schedule C from a business; and (b) are using the tax credit to offset income from their Schedule SE.  For taxpayers, you're claiming $125,000 as a business expense, which is $125k/yr, or $320,000/yr.  The IRS will send you a 1099 to show the income, and it will be reported to your taxes.  It is not taxable income to you, and you can deduct it.  If you are using the $125K for tax purposes, and it's a deductible business expense, you can deduct the entire amount from your taxes.\n",

If you look at the current models and models coming out, you will see that they are all fairly similar, with the exception of some minor differences.  It's just the way of things.

You will have a mortgaged home for the rest of your life, and it's not the same as owning a house, but it is a home.  You will never have to sell it, or pay any rent, or even take on a mortgage payment.  You will be renting it out to a person who will take over the mortgage, or take it off you.  You can even have it appraised, and make the payments.  I would recommend that you make the payments, and pay off the mortgage in 30 years.  If you do it this way you will have enough money for your retirement, and for the things you want in your life.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  You're not allowed to pay taxes by a check. The government has been trying to confuse you, because the IRS and the US Postal Service are using the same rules to confuse you. The IRS uses the \"in person\" check service, and the US Post Service uses the \"online\" check service.  The IRS uses a check to send you money, and the US post service uses a check to collect the money. The IRS only accepts money that is deposited in a bank account. The US Postal Service accepts money that is sent in a check, but the IRS only accepts checks.  When the IRS receives a check, it has to verify that you actually received it, and that you did send the check. If you don't receive a check, and you pay taxes, you can dispute it. The IRS can tell you that you didn't receive a copy of the check, but you did receive it, and the IRS can tell that you didn' t actually pay the taxes. So the IRS can only take a check that you have received and don't have to pay the taxes if you don't dispute it.\n",

      "Buying a home with down payment from family as a “loan”\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  Buying a house with a downpayment is like a mortgage. There are two basic kinds: The first is a HELOC, or Home Equity Line of Credit. You have to put up to $100,000 of the $100k you are planning to use for the downpayment on a house. The line of credit is secured against the property you're planning to buy. The line of debt will be secured against the equity of your home. When you refinance your mortgage, you usually get a HELOC instead of a HELOC. If you do refinance, you get the $10k from your line of credit and can use it to purchase your house. The second kind is a Line of Credit (LLC), which is used by a business to pay expenses. LLCs are secured by a liability of the business. You will need to pay the expenses out of your own money (you may be required to pay the expense by law, in which case you need to check your state law to be sure). A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is secured against the equities of your home\n",

In some jurisdictions the courts do make exceptions for certain breaches of duty. For example, if a company is acquired you can sue the acquiring company for some percentage of the value of the acquired company.  In some jurisdictitions, companies may not be able to avoid filing a lawsuit because they are already in breach of duty.\n",

      "What is the “Bernanke Twist” and “Operation Twist”? What exactly does it do?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  Bernanke, the central banker of the US, is the head of the Federal Reserve and runs the US economy. The Federal Reserve sets the interest rates and the inflation target. It has a big impact on the economy. Bernanke has to decide if he wants to go with inflation target of 2-3%, if he wants to keep interest rates low (2-3%) and if he wants to raise them (2-3%). If he decides to keep interest rates as they are currently, then he can make a decision on when he wants to raise interest rates. He can do that at any time, it will not be the time of the year. If he wants to raise rates at some point in the future, then he can do that. The Fed will take the decision when it is decided, it will be at the meeting of the Central Bankers. He will tell them what interest rate to keep and they will decide whether they are going with it or not. So it all depends on how much the economy is doing and how much interest rates are going up and down.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  This is the kind of thing I hate, because I think the advice you are receiving is wrong.  If you are going to be the landlord for the entire life of your tenancy, you must take all reasonable steps to ensure you are getting the best possible outcome for you.  That being said, there is nothing you can do to make your tenancy better. You are responsible for keeping your tenancy in a good condition.  You should make sure that the tenancy is well maintained and that the tenancy can be renewed if you have to. If you are a bad tenant, you are responsible for keeping you tenancy in good condition.  I am not a landlord, but I am a tenant, and I would never have thought of this before.  In the end, you need to take all reasonable steps so that you are not a bad tenant.  If you make the decision to do all the things that you said you would do, you will have a tenancy that is good.  If you don't take all reasonable steps, you are likely to end up with a bad tenancy.\n",

I would also imagine that it is likely that the scammer will make it their job to send money to a scammer's account, but that will be a lot harder to detect than a scammer using an actual bank account.  They will have to do their research, and use multiple methods to try to scam you.  That is how scams work.

      "understanding the process/payment of short sale dividends\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  The 10 day window in which you can exercise a short sale dividend is not the same as the 30 day window in the case of the S&P500, which has 15 days to expire. If the dividend is paid on 24 October 2017, you will have 30 days to exercise the dividend and pay the dividend on 27 October. You will be paid interest on the dividend, and your dividend will be reported on 14 November. The short sale dividend has no impact on your balance sheet until 27 October, and if you pay the dividend before 27 October you will have a tax benefit.  If the dividend was paid on 28 October, you will be required to pay the dividend as of 28 October. If you do not pay the dividend by 28 October then you will be required for the remaining period to repay the dividend.\n",

      " Answer:  This is actually pretty tough because you will have to account for the fees for the ETF and the fact that the company is a foreign company.  If you are just using P/E to decide on the mix, I would just use the P/E ratios of all the companies you would like to invest in.  If you have some interest in the specific companies then you can get a better idea of what mix is right for you. If you don't care what mix is right, just put in the P/E of the ETF and you should be ok.  If you want to be really fancy, you can do some calculations and just put the P/E ratio in.  For example, the P/E for CUBA is 11.97, so the ETF has a P/E ratio of 20.58.  So the P/E is 13.58.\n",

      " Answer:  I agree with what @JoeTaxpayer said, and I would suggest that you try to pay as much of it off as you can.  If you can do that, you will save a lot of money in interest and taxes over the long term.   I have a couple of student loans that I can no longer pay off due to interest rates, and I have been making good on them.  In fact, I have about $35k in student loan debt.  I have a lot of debt, but I am making good on it.  The interest rates on my loans are so low, and my taxes are so high that I have been saving money.  I will probably end up paying a little more in interest and tax than I would have been.  I am sure I have to pay off some of my loans, but I will make a lot more money that way.\n",

      " Answer:  This is a good question to ask yourself: \"Am I better off with a 30 year fixed or 15 year fixed mortgage?\"  The short answer is yes.  15 year mortgages are generally much better than 30 year mortgages.  The reason is that the 30 year is typically only 1/2 the amount that can be paid down.  The reason that 15 year mortages are often only 1/4 the amount is that the interest rate on 30 year loans is typically 1.5% or higher.\n",

      " Answer:  I would imagine the breakdown of the payment is in terms of interest and principal. You pay for interest, or you pay principal, or you pay off your loan. I would say that the breakdown is the same regardless of the amount. I have had several loans in the past 15 years and it is usually the same. The amount of interest you pay has no bearing on whether you pay principal or interest. If the loan amount is large enough you will pay interest, but you will pay it back.\n",

If you're looking for the best rate for your debt, you're probably better off with a 0% interest rate, especially since that will likely be the best rate you'll find.\n",

      "Why could rental costs for apartments/houses rise while buying prices can go up and down?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  Renting is not an investment. It is a financial decision. You are making a decision based on what is known as an expected return on investment, which is defined as the total return on your investment, minus your cost of buying it, minus the depreciation on the investment, minus any maintenance expenses. This is what is called the return on capital.  It's not a \"return\" in the sense of \"the cost of capital, which is the net present value of your investment.\" Rents have been going up over the last few years, but they are not as high as they used to be. It's because of the fact that a lot of people bought up in the housing bubble, and it was not an investment for the long term. That's when they were making money.\n",

You're not going to get the best advice from a mortgage broker.  It's a bad deal for him to have you go through all this trouble.  You've already tried this approach.  There's nothing wrong with it.  It'll just be easier to use the credit union account. If you don't mind paying extra to get the advice, that's probably worth a few hundred dollars.\n",

However, the value of your stock is determined by the demand for it.  People want to buy it.  People who want to sell it need to find buyers.

It's a little tricky to explain, but this is the basic idea of dividend reinvesting. You can do it in any account that you have money in, and you can choose how much to reinvest, and the percentage to reinvest. It's called reinvesting dividends in your account. The idea is that you don't reinvest the dividend. You reinvest it as you would a stock purchase. You would need to check the details, but it's not something you need to worry about.\n",

You will need to keep track of what income tax you paid in your year-end tax return, and pay any additional tax you are liable to pay in the future. You will also need to keep track whether or not you were paid by a contractor for your work. You will need to pay self-employment tax if you are self-employed.

Second, if your credit is very low, and you are still interested in applying for a credit card, you might get denied if they can't do a credit check. I doubt they will do a credit check on your credit, especially if you are applying for a card with no credit history.  If they can't even verify that you have no history, they probably won't give you a credit card, and they might as well just say that you didn't apply.  You might try to apply for a different card. You might also try calling your bank and ask for their business card number. If that doesn't work, then you might have to wait until next year to see if you have a better credit history. You might try the same with your employer. If they have you applied for another job and your employer is still rejecting your application, they might be doing a credit check on you. They might be denying you for your credit because you were denied for the past 6 years, which you probably didn't\n",

Some will be taxed at ordinary income, some at ordinary income, and some will be capital gains.   Dividends are generally taxed as ordinary income.  Some dividend-paying stocks can have dividends that are not taxed at ordinary level.  In this case, you can buy more shares of the company.  However, you have to pay tax on any dividend paid out.  So, you would have to pay taxes on any dividends you receive.  Also, dividends paid out to a publicly traded company are taxed as income to you.  If you are a private investor, you can also receive dividends from private companies as dividends.  But you will pay taxes on that income.\n",

In most cases the forger has no way of knowing who you are, and it is likely that the check is a forgery, which is usually treated very seriously.  Even if you never received a check, you might want to contact your bank and report it as a fraudulent check.   If they don't want to deal with it, you can try to contact them and tell them to not pay you for this, and that they will not contact you for the forged check again.  This is not likely to solve your problem, because you're not the one that wrote the check.  If they do want to deal with you, then they can call the bank and tell them that you have been fraudulently paid for this check.  They should be able to explain that you don't have authorization to use your name and address for this transaction.  You don't even have a valid checking account with that bank.

It's just that the job you choose will have a higher paying job to go along with it.  For instance, if you go from a $100K salary to a $150K salary, you still won't have $150k to invest.

The following numbers may be useful to get a sense of your impact: The best thing you can do to improve your score is to make your payments on time.  The sooner you make your payments the better off you will be.  If you have 15% utilization, then you will have 150% utilization.  This is 15% over 10 years.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I would say that companies should not be valued on the basis of their financial statements, as the stock prices are just that: estimates of what a company can expect to do in the future. The valuations of a company are based on the future expectations of the company and what they can do. That's why there is such a thing as \"dividend growth\", as the companies are paying dividends and reinvesting that money in future projects to grow the company. So it is really a guesswork as to whether a stock is going to be valued as high as you think it is, or as low as you think it will be.\n",

The futures have been moving in the opposite direction. In 2015, futures traders are moving in opposite directions. The futures have also been moving in the same direction in 2016, but it is a much different picture. In 24 hours from now, 2020, there is a 56% chance that gold will break through $1608.00 and stay there.  The futurist who predicted it in 2001 has said that the 2014 gold price was the lowest it has been in over 100 years. In 25 years the gold price has dropped from $1477.00 to a low of $1380.00.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  The penalty for early redemption depends on the type of loan and the amount of debt. You are entitled to a penalty if you owe money to the institution and the institution has not responded in 6 months. This is a fairly unusual situation. If you do not have a history of paying your loan in full every month, then you can pay the penalty as normal. If you do have a history of not paying your loan, you should contact your lender and request a review. If they agree to the review, then you should pay the penalty and then reapply for a loan. If you don't have a history of non-payment and you do have a bank account, then you will have to pay the penalty and request a review, which can take several months.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I can see two possible ways you might want to do this. First, if you're still using your old bank, it might be wise to try transferring some money from one of those banks to another to get a second opinion on whether they can make you whole.  It might also be a way to get a second bank that will let you use your old one to get your money in and out of that account.  If you do this, you might want to get an idea of how they handle the accounts if you transfer money from one bank to another, since that might not always be the case. Second, you could do a transfer from one account to another without any money being moved.  You could just transfer the money to another account, and the money from that account will be gone from your old account.  This might be more difficult for a new account than for an old account, since you don't know how that account is structured, but it might also make more sense for you. If you transfer money from another account to your new account without any money being transferred, you will need to check that the money isn't being moved out of your old account.

      " Answer:  One thing to consider is the risk of the investment. If you buy a house you are not going to be able to sell it. If you buy stocks, you can lose money, but if you buy a house, you can buy one and sell it, and sell it and get a higher return. In a nutshell, you are buying and selling the same stock. The important thing is to do it safely and responsibly. I am not sure if it is wise to buy stock in an illiquid company, but it is certainly safer than a stock that goes down a lot and loses money. I would definitely recommend you buy a good fund and then learn how to manage it, but I am not sure it is a great idea to start young.\n",

      " Answer:  I believe you have two questions here. 1) Is it considered a gift if you give them $5000 of your time and effort for free? or 2) Can they get your money by borrowing money from you?   The first question is an obvious one.  LLCs can do exactly that, lend you money.  That is, they can lend you money to the extent that you loan them money and they make interest on the money you lend. If you want to borrow money from a friend, that is a gift.  If you give them $10000, they have $100,000.  If you loan them $10,001, they have $4,000,025.  The first question is not really the most important one for a LLC.  I am not sure how a LLC will do that, but it would be a good idea. 2) Is it considered income? If the LLC gives you $100 each time they give you $10, then it is income.  That is what a profit is.  In the US, most LLC\n",

You'll get paid back in the form of a call, or you'll have to sell the underlying stock to pay the premium.  The option price will always be at or near the strike price of the call, so it's always the right thing to do.

      "New to investing — I have $20,000 cash saved, what should I do with it?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  One thing that you should consider is that you have a very high interest rate debt on your credit card.  I'm not sure if this is normal, but if you look at your credit card statement, you'll see that you have a 25% APR interest rate.  You are paying 25% interest, which is $1200 a month.  That's about $14,000 in interest a year.  You could pay off the 25% of that debt.  However, this is a risk.  If you lose your job, you may have trouble getting a job or being able to pay your bills.  If you don't have money to cover those things, you may have a hard time making it.  You will want to be sure that you can get the job you want before you put money into something that you can't afford to lose.  That'll be the risk.\n",

I called the card company and asked if they could raise my limit from 50% to 60% so that I could pay off the balance in full. They said they would do that, and would charge me a small fee. I called back and asked if I could pay off my balance in full in 6 months instead of paying interest, but they said they would have to charge me a fee. I did not want to pay a fee to get my credit card interest rate lower, so I decided to just pay off the $100 balance as fast as possible.

      " Answer:  There's no direct impact on your credit score. However, if you have a good credit history, your score will increase. I have heard the theory that when you are young you will get a good credit history. This means that if you get into a good car you can expect a good credit score.  However, I don't have a good credit score, and I doubt I will get one. I've been trying to make my credit history good. If I can get my credit score up, I'll be able to buy a car.\n",

The bid price is just the lowest price of the highest bid, while the ask price is the lowest price of highest ask.  You can get a bid price and ask price of the same ask (e.g. you can get the ask price of 100 and the bid price of 1) by looking at a trade history.

You can't buy individual stocks in the stock market, you can't buy index funds, you can''t buy individual bonds, etc. You can buy a mutual fund or ETF that will do all of those things, but that's just as risky.

The value of the cash is reflected in the stock price of the company, not the stockholders' equity.  It is also reflected in the value of the company.  If you sell stock at a loss, the difference between the price you paid for the stock and the price you sell it at is your \"capital gain\". If you sell stock with the intention of getting a return, you will pay taxes on any gains you get from selling stock.  But if you buy more stock than you sold, and sell it, you will receive tax on any gains.  You may also have to pay tax on the sale.\n",

If you default on the loan, you'll still owe it for 25 years.  That's a lot of money.  I'm guessing your interest rate is around 4%?  And your payment is going to be at least 4%?

I was asked to transfer money to the account, which I did, and my bank details were not stolen. However, it was all done by the same person, and I was also asked to send money from my bank account to the scammers, which I did. I don't know how they managed to get my SSN and bank details.

If you are in the US, you would pay self-assessment tax on any income that you get in the US. In the US, the difference between the amount of income and the amount you pay in taxes would be considered your salary. If you don't pay your salary, it is taxable income. The IRS may want to see the difference between the amounts you pay and the amount you receive, because that could be the difference between paying your own taxes or paying your own.\n",

      "Is it better to buy a computer on my credit card, or on credit from the computer store?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  I would not recommend the computer store as a long term investment.  I've seen some of the other answers here suggest that they can be a good long term investment for the right person.  The reality is, though, that they have a long term problem: they're going to have to pay for the computer for the next 10 years or more.  And in the meantime, they're going out of business.  If you buy a computer for a month, and then have to pay for it for 10 years, you can expect to be out of business in a few years. I would not recommend the credit card as a long term, high risk investment.  It will take a long time for you to pay for it.  If you can't afford it, you'll be in trouble.  And if you're going to be in trouble, the store is going to be in a lot of trouble.\n",

      " Answer:  The best answer I can give is that there are a lot of investments out there.  Investments can be a great thing, as you said, but only when you invest the right amount of money and choose the right type of investment.  In this case, I would suggest an ETF (exchange-traded fund).  This is a good way to buy stocks and securities, and it can be a good way to invest in a diversified portfolio, which is a good thing.  You can find one at a lot of online brokers, including Schwab.  It can be a bit trickier to get a good one.  You can probably get a decent one at a discount brokerage firm, such as Ameritrade, but I'd be careful.  The fees that you pay for stocks and secsurities are generally pretty high, especially for a non-registered account.  You can do your own research, and look for something like Vanguard's Total Stock Market.  You can buy and sell stocks through it, and you can do your research through the web.

You should be sure that you're not getting a 1 cent return on a tax-deductible investment, and that you're really getting a return of 1% or more on the interest.

You can't predict the price of bonds. Inflation is a big thing. If inflation increases the interest payments, it's likely to be higher.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  You need to keep track of your assets. It's easy to get too busy, and forget to put money away, or you can't afford to, so you can't invest. In the UK you can open a Savings Account at a bank, but I doubt you'll find a savings account at a bank that doesn't charge you interest.  You can keep track of your investments by opening a brokerage account, but this is a bit of a pain. It is possible to set up a brokerage but the fees can be high, and the time it takes to set up a new account is usually not worth it. I think the easiest thing to do is invest in stocks, which you can buy directly from a company, rather than investing through a broker. If you want to invest in a few stocks, it will probably take 3 or 4 weeks to get to a point where you're confident enough to buy them. I'd start by putting the money you're saving into a savings account. If you want a bigger slice of your portfolio you could buy a mixture of stocks.\n",

I don't think you can tell how people value things by the time they actually get them.  If you buy them at $100, you might think you're getting a good deal on a pair of sunglasses.  But you might have no idea how people value them.  They might have a value, but not an accurate one.  So the question of whether you should be valuing stocks at all is not really the point of this question.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I would recommend investing the money in your savings.  That's how you are going to get the best return.   Your savings should be in a bank account that you can access on demand.  Your savings should also be in a CD or other safe instrument.  You should also be able to open a brokerage account.  It doesn't really matter what you do with your savings, just that you do it.  I would advise against saving up money for the long term.  The money should be put aside for the short term.  For example a new TV, car or home purchase.  You should never buy more than you can afford to lose.   My advice is to just do what you feel comfortable with.  Don't worry about getting a job, getting a mortgage or the next big thing.  It's just money that will go down the drain.  So, don't worry.  Just do it.  You should always do it.  If you can't, just start saving money for the long run.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  In the U.S. we call this a \"security check\". It is not uncommon to have multiple hard inquiires. You are just asking for too many.  The first thing you need to do is call the lender and ask for a hard inquiry to be placed on a different loan. You'll also want to ask for a hard inquiries to be placed on your other credit cards. The hard inquiries are not necessarily a bad thing. It is just a way of keeping your credit score low.  If you're applying for a car loan, the hard inquiries will likely be placed on a credit report and your score will be impacted. If you're asking for a mortgage, they may be placed on a mortgage report and your score is impacted. If your loan officer asks for multiple hard inquiions, you should be able to answer yes, and then just pay the bills on time. If you've already done this before, it is probably a good idea.\n",

It's easy to get into a situation where you have to ask for help, and don't need to be asked for help.  The first thing I'd do is get a part-time job.  If you can make $1500/week for 20 hours a week, you'll be able to make enough money to save enough to buy a house in a few years.  If you have a part-time position and you can get a loan, take it.

He can use the money from the sale to finance the next home, or he can use the money to purchase another home.  This can result in a home that has more equity than it would have if the seller had taken the money from the loan.  It also gives the seller of the home more options in which to use the funds for other investments. In the situation that you describe, there is little that the seller can do to change the terms of the loan.\n",

      " Answer:  This is a great idea, I just have a small problem.  My wife and I have a property (2.5% equity) with a mortgage on a house we are selling.  I have a small business I do, and we pay all of the bills and pay off the mortgage.  We have a large mortgage on our rental property (40K) that we are paying off.  When the house is sold, we will pay the mortgage off completely.  We have been making this arrangement for a while, and have never paid taxes on the mortgage and the interest is only 15% of the mortgage payment.  The 10% we are getting from the interest is a nice chunk of change.  So, I've been thinking of doing this for a while, but we are not ready to change our habits.  It's nice to know that we are doing this for the right reasons, and I think that is good.\n",

      "Are bonds really a recession proof investment?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  Bonds are generally considered safe, even during periods of recession. If you want to make sure, consider the following:  (1) Inflation: Bonds are expected to pay a little more, which is generally a good thing. However, inflation is usually very high. If you are talking about a very long term, it's possible for inflation to be 5% or more. If inflation is really high, consider that your investment is likely to be in a high risk, inflationary asset. (2) Interest Rates: Interest rates are usually low, which means you are likely to have some cash to spend if needed.  You will be much more vulnerable to inflation if your bond is underwater. If inflation isn't that bad, you can try to sell your bond to raise capital.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  It is a very common practice. It is called the \"diluted\" principal method of payment.  It's where the bank will charge a higher rate for a monthly payment that doesn't meet the criteria.  It'll charge you higher if you're underwater, for example, and your mortgage is 20% underwater.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  It is because they are trading in what is known as a bid ask spread. It is used to try and capture a price movement and can be used by people to try and get a bid ask spread, which is basically a spread between a bid and ask price. It is the price of the last trade on that day. So if the day started out low, the bid ask spread can be as low as 1 or 2 cents. The last trade for that day, the highest ask price was at $10.50, which means if you bought the stock at that price, you would get the same amount of money as you would for any other stock if the price was $10.00. That is what happens when there is no news.\n",

      "Optimal way to use a credit card to build better credit?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  It really depends on how the store manages your account and how it is managed.  The store manager could tell you to use it and not pay interest.  He could tell you to pay off the balance every month so that you never have to pay interest.  It is also possible to pay it off each month and not pay interest, but you might pay more interest.  But if they are able to figure out how to manage your account better, that's good.  That's a huge benefit. If the store has a good credit score manager, then I would say you should pay off the balance each month and pay off the credit card.  Otherwise you might want to have the credit card as well.  Paying off the balance every time you pay it off can be a nightmare.  The store might want you to pay the bill and it can get annoying.  If you use the card and never pay it off, then they will want you to pay it off and get you a better rate on your next credit card.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  You will pay the 10% rate on the gains, so if you are in the top 20% of the US population you will have the full 10% on your gains.  So if you are in this group, you are likely in the top 10% of taxpayers.  If you are in the 15% group, your tax rate is 12.2% and if you are in 20% tax bracket, your tax rate will be 12.8%.  If you are taxed at 20%, you will pay $1,413.80 (15% * 10% / 12.38) * 10.03% = $1,498.35.  Your tax rate is $13,375.40 (15.05% * 20%) * 100% = $15,470.25.

I'm not sure the bank has any legal obligation to sell your house, but you may want to consult a bankruptcy attorney.\n",

      " Answer:  The standard way to think of it is this: In this case, you can assume that you have a $200k house worth $100k in cash.  In the next 18 months, you will pay a mortgage of $10000 and $2000/mo.  At $100/mo, the rent is $2500.  You've already paid $100 of that $250.  Now that you've paid $250, you've paid it off.  $200 is the amount you need to pay off to get that $100,000 debt off your books. The $100 is what you can use to pay the rent, so that's $200.\n",

      "What is the meaning of “writing put options”?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  In simple terms, put options are contracts that specify a price to be paid for a certain option. For example, I want to buy a call option on Apple stock at $100 a share. I want to sell that option at the end of a year. I want to get a guaranteed profit of $100. The company will let me buy that option at the current price. If the company wants to do that, I can do that too. Put options are used for all sorts of things, but mostly for leveraged options. You buy a call option in a leveraged option. If you buy a call option that has an expiration date in June 2016, that's what you do.  You buy a put option in a levered option. If you do that, the price of the stock goes up and down with the option. That's what I did in the example above. You can use it to buy puts in options that are leveraged to a certain extent.\n",

      "Are mutual funds safe from defaults?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  No. In the past, banks would have deposited money in banks with \"negative\" interest rates, because they would have been willing to lose money.  The bank would not be forced to accept negative rates because banks would have deposit money in the bank that would have received negative rates.  In 2008-2009, many banks ran afoul of this.  This is why people would have to be careful in the future.  Banks are more riskier than the US stock market.  The US stock market is not a bad thing, and the US stock market has been growing steadily since the financial crisis.  The US has had several times as many stocks than the entire EU.  I don't think this is the issue, though.  If you can't trust banks, the best way to avoid banks is to invest in the market.  If you want to invest in the stock market, you can invest in ETFs.  But you will be riskier than stocks and the returns are not very good.\n",

      "Why do people use mortgages, when they could just pay for the house in full?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  There is no reason to pay off a mortgage early. In fact, the most common reason for people to pay off a loan early is to save the most money they can afford to invest.  A house can be paid off early with 50% equity in the house. This is what I would do if I had money to spare. If I had 100% equity, I would take out a loan at 30 years and pay it off.  If you have an emergency, paying down the loan is not a good idea. In the end, it comes down to the money you are saving and the mortgage you are paying. If I was you I would save the most money I can and invest it.  The only reason you may not want to do this is if you are paying off a home that is very old and will not be worth as much as the house you are living in now.  For example, if the home you are living in is worth $200,000 and you have 30 years left on the loan you are paying down, then you would be better off with an investment property than a house that\n",

      " Answer:  No. The tax treatment is different for different kinds of actions, and not all of those actions are tax-free. The general idea is that if you take action 1, the IRS may ask you to take action 2, and that you may get in trouble. If you don't take action 1 and take action 2 instead, they will ask you to take the action 2, so that you will take the IRS's advice and not go to jail.  In practice, this is a complicated thing, and it is often a question of what you think should be done. If I take action 1 in response to a lawsuit, I may be in trouble, but I have to decide whether I want to take action 1.  If I take action, then the IRS will ask me to take action, and I will take action. That will be fine, as I don't want to pay taxes on my action.\n",

If you don't want to pay someone for something that is not for you, then you should not pay them for something that you do not want to do.  The whole idea of \"the law of diminishing returns\" is to think about things from your perspective.  If you do not care to pay for the space, then why are you paying for it?  If you are going to pay them for something they do not want to be doing, then why do you want to do that?  You should not be paying them for their business.  If you are thinking that you are just making a bad decision, you need to think about why you made that bad decision.  If you make a bad decision for the sake of being a bad decision, then you are doing something very wrong.  It is never a good idea to make bad decisions for the sake of getting a bad one.\n",

      "Is there a way to buy raw oil today and sell it in 1 year time?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  You have to understand that the oil is a very liquid asset that can be traded and sold like stocks. There are many exchanges that can be used for the trades and some of the exchanges have trading fees. You can also look at the futures market for oil futures and the options market for oil options. Oil futures are available in 200 contracts which is 200000 barrels. This is an average amount and if you want to trade more it would be more expensive. There is no trading fee and you can trade more than 200 barrel. The options are available for 200,000 contracts and they are also available in 2,000,014 contracts. So if you are looking to sell your oil, you need to sell more than 2,064 contracts and you will be charged a fee. You can also sell oil futures contracts in the market for 1,250 contracts and it will cost you less.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  In the US, the price of USD (or any other currency) is determined by the strength of USD, and the strength of the USD itself is generally determined by the strength and volatility of USD. That is, if the strength of US is determined by the \"volatility\" of the currency, the strength of US may not be as important as the strength of US and the volatility of the currency. So if the strength of the currency, US, is determined by its strength and volatilty, the strength of the dollar is determined by its volatility. The strength of the dollard will likely also be determined by the strength, volatility, of the other currencies (like the EUR). So it is not that much of a difference.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  The mortgage rate is a function of the interest rate and not of the principal balance. If the interest rate is 2.5% and the principal balance is 225K, then you should pay 2.5*100K and not 2.5-100K because the interest is the same.  If the interest rate was 4% and the principal is 224K, then you would pay 2.4*100.000 and not 2*100*0.040532.  If you are not sure, then paying off your mortgage and investing is a good idea.\n",

For example, you can buy the stock in Apple or Facebook (or a similar company) by paying a premium. That's what it's called. A derivative is a financial product that gives you the right to buy it (or sell it) at a higher price than it currently is. I think the term \"derivative\" came from the fact that it was common to buy or sell derivative products before the product was ever officially called one.\n",

      " Answer:  In the US you are required to open an IRA and contribute $5000 to it, and you must invest in the stock market. There are rules for how much of your IRA is allowed to be invested in stocks, and how much of it can be in a balanced portfolio. If your IRA is large enough to hold all your investments, then you are allowed to contribute $50,000 per year.  If you are investing in a balanced fund, you should consider buying some additional shares of your investment to keep up with inflation.  Your IRA investment can be purchased in a variety of ways.  You can contribute a portion of your IRA to an IRA fund (which is typically an ETF or a stock) and then invest the rest. You can invest in individual stocks as well as in balanced portfolios of individual stocks and balanced portfolos of stocks.

      "Calculating profits for a private fund\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  This is a pretty good question. I will attempt to answer it in the best possible way.  For a small cap fund, there is a 2% expense ratio, so 2% of $2500 is $2.50.  That is $250/yr. So the $1000 is $100/yr.  This is about 14% a year.  Now you need to find the $10,000.  So you are going to need to figure out the $10K from the 2% and put it in a bank.  I am guessing it is 3-4% for a very long term.  So I will do this: So the $1,000 is about $1,020.  The $250 is $254.80, and $20 is 30%.  I can figure out how much I need to put away each year to have enough to pay the $10k. So I can set up a savings account to have the money for 2 years, then pay $2000 each year for\n",

However, you have the option of being in an asset class that is doing quite well.  For example, a mutual fund is doing quite well for a while and then it's done.  You might want to look at the fund you're in, and consider whether it is a good buy now or whether it is a bad buy now.  If the fund has gone up a lot then you might want to rebalance to a different fund and maybe look at a different asset class.

If you have the desire and are willing to do the work and put in the work, then this could be a good option.  But it depends on you.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I would strongly suggest you talk to an accountant (EA/CPA licensed in your State) who specializes in business entities, and is familiar with the legal structure and tax code in your State. I have found that most private limited companies are structured like a partnership, where the owner of the company is a sole proprietor, and the business is a separate business from the owners. There are a number of companies that have this structure, including the companies that you are looking at. You can find information on the IRS website.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  The simple answer is that this is just a \"money-market\" type thing.  The company's earnings are already known and publicly available, so the \"money-money\" analogy is justified.  The stock price has no correlation to the earnings, so the stock price is just an \"opportunity\" to buy into the earnings.  As a result, there is no \"reasonable expectation\" that the stock price will ever move.  That is not to say it won't move, but it's unlikely to get that much.\n",

      "What would be the appropriate account for written off loans to friends and family?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  There are two accounts you should keep separate: One for the money you loaned, and the one you're getting paid from. This should be an account you can't lose access to, or at least you can't use as a safety net. For example, if your employer pays you $5000/yr, and you have a loan at a credit card company at $500/yr for the same reason, you can't just use it to pay your loans off. If you have a mortgage and a car payment, it is a bad idea to have both.\n",

      " Answer:  In the end, it's really about personal preference and your personal situation.  There are two factors I like to consider: What is your reason for owning the company stock?  If you own it because you are looking to buy more stock at a discount, this is fine. If you buy it to diversify your portfolio and invest in other stocks, this is a good way to do so.  I don't believe that buying more stocks at a discount is a good idea for a number of reasons. If you can't decide if you are buying more stock at a lower price or a higher price, you may want to consider buying some more shares at the discount.  In that case, you are probably looking at the discount at a bad time.\n",

You have a job, a family, and are willing to sacrifice some of your income in order to put your money where your mouth is. You've put the work into the house, but the market has not yet decided that you are the right person for this property.  You're not a bad person, you just don't have the experience to get a rental property into the kind of shape that you are. You can make money in real estate.  It will take work, but you can make money.  Don't get discouraged, but if you're not a good person for a property, you won't be able to sell it, and that's not necessarily bad.\n",

      " Answer:  If you want to invest in stocks long term you need to diversify.  The key here is not diversification, but a risk tolerance.  A few common examples of what you could do include: 1. Buy individual stocks (for example stocks with a high dividend payout) or individual companies (such as Apple, Facebook). 2. Invest in international stocks or international companies (such as Exxon, Coca Cola, etc). 3. Invest in individual bonds (for example bonds with a high dividends). 4. Invest in mutual funds (such as Vanguard, Fidelity, Vanguard, etc). 5. Invest in real estate investment trusts (for example real estate with a high yield). 6. Invest in an individual retirement account (IRA) or a tax deferred account (TFSA). 7. Invest in a stock-based ETF (for example an S&P ETF, which will have a high dividend).\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  You are basically paying a mortgage with interest.  The money you are borrowing is a loan.  The amount you are paying to the bank is called your payment. If you are making an extra payment every month, you will pay more interest.  If you are paying extra each month, you are actually paying more interest.  So you will have a higher payment and a higher rate.  Your payment will be lower but you will be paying more interest over time.\n",

But you have a job, you are married and are expecting another child.  If you do not pay off the loan you are not going to be able to pay the child support.  If you keep making payments on the loan you will end up in a situation where you have to sell the house or move in with a family.  If you are not able to make your payments then you will end up paying the bills of a family member or you will lose your job.\n",

The fact that you've already paid is no evidence that you're in trouble, and I wouldn't think that you'd have to worry about your account being debited or credit in any way, unless you're doing something that is fraudulent.  The fact that you didn't pay the debt is no evidence that it is a fraud, and I wouldn understand the urge to be cautious of what you're paying. If you're worried that you're going to be audited for some reason - I wouldn't hold out hope that you'll be audited, but if you're not, I would suggest that you might consider the possibility of some fraud and paying off the debt.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  There is a way to shop for a mortgage at the bank and get the rates you want, without paying too much.  The first step is to go to the bank and apply for a loan.  You will need to provide the exact same information as you did with the application (which you probably already did).  If you can provide it, they should be able to give you the rates you want.  They may not be exactly the rates you want but it's worth a shot.  You will want to check with them if you have an interest rate drop from the loan, but you should be able to get it back.   The interest rate is only a snapshot of what you will end up paying over the life of the loan.  It's not the actual amount you pay, but just the interest rate you are getting on the mortgage.   You can't shop for a mortage until you've applied, so that's the first thing you'll need to do.  The first few banks will let you do that, but you should probably wait a while.\n",

If you want to be conservative, you could do whatever you want, and just wait it out. If you want something more aggressive, you could invest in REITs.  You could buy an REIT (real estate investment trust) with $100K and put the money into a mutual fund that pays 7-8% per year. If you want a more aggressive approach, you could invest 1% per year into the market. The market has dropped a lot since you wrote this, so I think it's fair to say that you're doing pretty well.\n",

      "How to quantify differences in return with low expense ratio vs high expense ratio mutual funds?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  You have some good answers, and some interesting thoughts.  I would like to address the first point.  When we are talking about expense ratios we are looking at the total cost, not just the dividends paid.  If you were to look at the performance of the mutual fund you would find that a high expense ratio fund would have lower returns than a low expense ratio fund. The difference in returns comes from dividends paid.   I would like to add another point.  You can do a simple math and determine that a low expense mutual fund would be better than a high expense mutual funds.  A high expense fund is going to have higher expenses than a low expendence fund.  That is because the expenses are going to be a percentage of the total value of the fund, not a percentage of the value of the fund. So if you buy a fund that pays 8% you will have to pay 0.8% on the fund.  That's not going to be a bad thing, but you would still have to pay 8% of the value of your portfolio.  If you buy a fund with a high expense rate\n",

      "Is selling put options an advisable strategy for a retiree to generate stable income?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  Selling a put option means that you are not making any profit at all, and the only way you can get back on the option is if you decide to sell the option. It is a terrible idea for an old person to sell an option. The only way to get a return on a put option is to buy another option and sell it.\n",

      "What is the options industry changing about option symbols in February, 2010?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  The most obvious one is the price of options.  The prices have been a little different.  In the US, the price of a put option is 42.55, while the price of a call option is 34.5.  That's a difference of 1% (and 3% if you have an options position).  If you have a call option, you have to wait for the price to settle.  If the price settles at 14.5, you'll have to wait for 30 days to get a call option.  In some cases you can even take the position at a discount.  A good example is the put option on a 200 share stock.  You could take the put and then sell at $30. If the stock is 250, you can get a call option for $14.5. If the stock goes to $30, you'll get $14.80 for your put option, plus $1.10 for your call option.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  The main advantages of Swiss banks are the following: The Swiss banking system is very much based on a single product, namely the Swiss franc.  So in addition to being extremely cheap (unlike many other currencies) it is also very liquid.  It's quite easy to exchange money from one Swiss bank to another, if you don't have the Swiss franc. If you do have a Swiss franc, then you don't need a Swiss bank.  You can use it anywhere and at any time.  The bank will never take money from you. The main reason people use Swiss banks is because the Swiss franc is cheap and they can get money from anywhere.  If you're a big exporter, you may have to use the Swiss franc.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  It seems like the stock market is more of a place where people go to for advice than a place where people actually buy/sell/sell stock. People buy and sell stock on a daily basis. But it doesn't take long to see that prices are moving in one direction or the other and people are going to buy or sell based on the direction that price is moving. The only thing that is driving the price of stock is the demand. The people that buy and sell are people who have a position in the stock. People who sell are people who think that they can get a better price on that stock. The price of a stock is determined by demand. If everyone is going to sell their position because the stock is moving up or down then the demand for that stock will decrease. It will take a few days for that stock to move in the direction that the demand for that price is moving towards.\n",

      " Answer:  I am not aware of any way that Vanguard has a \"diversification strategy\". You can't diversify in a portfolio, and it is difficult to invest in more than one asset class. For example, if you have $200K in an IRA, and $20K in a bond fund, and another $10K in stocks, you are diversified.  Vanguard doesn't have \"diversification\", but it has \"index funds\", which do diversify.  You can also put in a Roth IRA with Vanguard, and they do provide a variety of index funds.\n",

      " Answer:  As others have said, there is plenty of opportunity to be profitable in the stock market.  There are plenty of investments that you can make.  In fact, I would argue that you can do better by simply not buying any of those stocks.  For instance, you can buy into many large cap companies that pay dividends.  Some dividend stocks have double digit returns (over 10% for some), and that is what I personally like.  And if you have no other investments, you can invest in low-cost index funds that track the S&P 500.  I think the 10 year S&P 100 index would be a good way to invest in a stock market.  Invest in a broad market index like the Russell 2000, for instance.\n",

It can be in real estate, stocks, bonds, or any other asset class you want to invest in. I will admit that I don't have a lot of experience with investments, but I have done some of the following investments and it worked out pretty well: I bought some land and got 300 sq ft for $150,000, which is less than the car I am planning on buying. The reason is because it is a land-only property. It is not an investment. I would strongly suggest you do not buy this property unless you are sure you can pay the rent for the next 20 years. It will have to be an income-producing property, or else you will be living on the street.\n",

You don't have to have a cosigning bond, but you do have to have a loan.  You can borrow money for a house, for example, or for a car.  The problem with cosigning a loan is that you are effectively giving up the right to make payments, if the cosigner is incapacitated. If you cosign a loan, you are not \"making payments\".  You are actually \"borrowing\" the money.  If your cosigner can't make payments, the cosigner is at risk of bankruptcy, as well as the borrower.\n",

If you are looking at the mortgage, you will need to take into account the amount of money you are paying for the mortgage.   If you are on the mortgages in your area, you will be required to pay a deposit, which is typically 10% of the purchase price.  That deposit will be a huge part of the mortgage payments, and I would be very surprised if you can manage to keep up with the payments.  If you get to a point where the mortgage costs are so high that you are considering moving out, then the mortgage would have to go up and you could get in trouble.\n",

For example, the price of stocks is typically not a price of the last price, but rather the last price at which someone sold or bought it.  That is what a bid or ask is for.  This is what happened to the S&P500 on February 15, 2015.   The price of the S&P 500 is $250.11 at 11:54am on February 16, 2008.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I would be hesitant to call this strategy a 'consolidation' because of the risks involved. There is no 'consolidation' in a debt consolidation plan. Debt consolidation plans are not a way to 'finance' your debts. It is a way to reduce your debt by paying off the smallest amount of debt at a fixed rate of interest. Debt consolidation plans are just the latest form of debt consolidating, and are not a good way to reduce your monthly debt burden. The primary goal of debt consolidating is to reduce your debts by reducing the principal owed on your debts. If you're concerned about your debts being 'overpaid' and not being able to pay off your debts, you should always talk to a financial planner.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  In my experience, your parents will have to take care of themselves, which means that you will need to take care of yourself too.  I would say that you need to start paying yourself first.  This means you need to pay yourself first.   If they never paid Social security, they will have to pay into the government.  You will have to take on some of the risk yourself, which means you will have to pay the interest on that debt.  If they are really poor, you will have to take a loan from the government and pay back.   If they are really old, you will have trouble getting help from your parents.  If they get really old, they may have trouble making it.  This is where you will have to be careful.   If they do not pay into the government, they will have difficulty getting loans from the government, which is why you will have to do all the work.   If they cannot get loans from the bank, you will have difficulty getting a loan from a bank.   If they need to get loans from a bank, you will be the one taking on the risk of that loan.

      " Answer:  First off, if you're interested in diversifying, and you don't mind the level of risk you're willing to take on, the safest thing to do is to have your investments in different places. The safest way to do this is to have different portfolios.  If you are concerned about volatility and want to have a diversified portfolio that has more diversification, that is fine.  The safest thing to keep track of is to keep track of your portfolio and make sure it's not over-diversified, which means that if you lose a lot of money on a single stock, you might lose it all on a single stock in the same year.

They can set the Fed's rate by the FOMC meeting. If the FOMC meets in December they will be able to raise the rate by 100 bps. They can raise it by 101 bps, 102 bps, 201 bps. If the FED raises the rate, the FOMC can do the same. The Fed can lower the interest rate.  If the economy is in trouble, they can lower interest rates. If the economy is healthy, they can raise interest rates.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I agree with everyone else that you need to speak to a lawyer. However, I will address a few other aspects that are missing from the original question. As far as the creditor, it is possible that the bank may have a contract with you for them to take you to court if you can prove that you didn't pay.  However, I doubt that they will take you to court, especially if they have already taken you to court for another reason. If they can't prove that you didn’t pay, that doesn't mean they can't try to get a judgment in your favor.  You will need to find out the details of the contract before you sign it, but I think they may have to get a court order or other paperwork in your favor in order for them to try to get you to settle. You don't need to take them to court, but you can try to get a better deal for yourself, and hopefully they'll let you out of this.\n",

      "Saving money in college while paying for college\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  If you want to save the most money, the way you are thinking may be a little confusing to a lot of people. So, the simplest thing is to just save money in general and pay for it later. I suggest you not to go to debt consolidation loans companies and paying the debts with them. They do not offer a good product, they charge high interest rates and they will give you a loan with a high balance at first, then you pay it back in a shorter period. That is how you can lose a lot of money in such debts. If you have a car loan, for example, you pay it off with a new loan at first, but then you get a new car loan and you have to pay it off in a different way. You have to pay the new car loan with the old car loan. So, it is really good to pay off your car loan with a new loan. The new loan will be a loan that you will pay off with a new car loan later.\n",

      "Buying a house, how much should my down payment be?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  The key is to figure out how much money you will have for the next 20 years or so and determine how much of that you can get for that money. This is called your down payment. It is a percentage of the purchase price of the house. If you are looking to buy a house, you will want to be aware of the minimum amount of money you can get to buy a house. You want to be sure you are not paying a lot of money to have your dream house. You should try to buy a house that is within your means. A good way to determine if you can afford the house is to figure out what you would need to put down on the house and how much you can put down. If you can afford it, go for it. If you are not sure, you should also do a home appraisal to figure out what the value of the house is.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I am not sure that this is a common problem, but in the UK it is possible to be in a situation where you have both a student loan and an auto loan at the same time. In this situation, if you have both of them at the same time, you are effectively having two student loans in one. As you are currently paying £300 to the car loan, it is likely that you will have an additional £300 (or more) to the student loan, and you will still have a total of £17,000 of debt, so it makes sense to make sure you get the car loan paid off. If you are not already at the top of the student loan ladder, and have not been for the last 12 months, then I would say you might be a little over the top.\n",

I'm not sure if you are paying too much into it, but you are probably paying too much.  You are paying more into the Vanguards Total Stock Market Fund than you are into the Vanguarud Total Stock Market Fund (which you probably should be investing in).  I'm sure you are getting the right amount of stocks into the fund.  I think you need to do some research on what fund to invest in, and if the fees are acceptable.  If you have a 401k, you should probably just max it out and invest that money.  Otherwise I think you are paying a pretty big amount into the Vanguarde Total Stock Market Fund and I think you are probably payin too much.\n",

You may find it difficult to get an actual loan for the money you want to borrow, and if you are in this situation you will be in a worse position than you have now. You will probably be denied by the credit union.  You are not being disadvantaged by this.  You are simply being disadvantged by the bank.  This is what happens when you have an overdraft or a missed payment.  This is how the bank gets away with a lot of things that you have done in the past.

The real rule of thumb is: if you have $100K in debt, and you are not making a large amount of money, you should pay off debt as soon as possible. 10% is not a bad rule, just not a smart thing to do.

      "Do Americans really use checks that often?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  Yes, the majority of people do.  That's not really true, though.  In the US the amount you owe is not the same thing as the amount of money you actually have in your account.  So even if you did pay the bills in full, you still owe money to the bank.  This can be true for taxes, insurance, student loans, credit cards, and even for your creditors.  But it's not true for a bank.  For example, you could be the bank's owner and you can owe the bank.  You can also owe the bank in other ways, such as a mortgage.  The bank doesn't know you exist, but the bank can know who you are.  The bank knows that you owe the bank a check, so they can know that the bank owes you.  But that's not the bank's responsibility.  It's your responsibility to pay the money back to the bank.\n",

If the seller has a high ask and the buyer has a low ask, it will be opposite. If a selling buyer has a bid and the selling seller has a ask, it will also look like a selling seller and a selling buiser. If the selling selling buyer is a high ask, the buyer selling the stock at that moment will have a bid ask and vice versa. If the siding is a selling buying the stock at that time, it will look a selling sider and a selling ask.

You can also check the fund's prospectus for dividend reinvestment, and that is another way to get dividends.  As for why it is not advisable to do this, well I don't know. Dividends are a nice way to get a portion of the profits from a stock or fund and it gives the investor more control over what happens with the company. Dividends, on the other hand, have the added problem that you need to pay tax on that money and you don't necessarily want that. I think there are a lot of people that are just fine with the dividend. It just makes sense to pay tax on it. I'm in a similar situation, and I pay taxes on most of my investments.\n",

      " Answer:  As I mentioned in the comments below, there are a number of factors that can cause oil prices to drop. The main thing to look out for is the change in the oil price. The main factor is the change in oil price in the past few days. It may have changed recently, but that may not be the case for some of the more recent events. If the price of oil has dropped by a significant amount, then it may not be for you. You should always look at the news for the major oil companies that are involved in the supply and demand of oil. If that company has seen a drop in oil prices recently, you can check their website to see if that is the case for them. You can check their website for more information. If the oil company has seen a large drop in oil prices, it may have been a signal that there was an increase in demand, which means that the demand is going up. The price is probably going to go up again, so you might not want to get involved. If the price drops again, then that might be an indication that the demand is starting to pick up again, so that might be a signal that they are starting to see a change in demand and prices.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I don't know what you mean by \"highest interest.\" It may be different for each debt. My mortgage is a good example.  When I got my mortgage, I was told the minimum payment was $1800. I was able to pay off the mortgage with the highest interest rate. I had to pay the minimum payment each month though, as the minimum payment is $1000 per month. I had a car loan, which was about $300 per month, so I paid the minimum payment, which is $200 per month (assuming no other payments are due in the next 6 months). I did have a HELOC, which I paid off with no additional fees.  The bank has told me to put extra money away for emergencies, but it seems they only care about the minimum payment. I know it's not the minimum payment, but I don't care what I pay. I am happy with my finances.  If you are looking at the whole picture, and not just the minimum payment, you may have a good idea of what's going on.  That is what the bank told\n",

      "Minor stakes bought at a premium & valuation for target company\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  It seems like you are looking at the numbers from the 2013 earnings report. It looks like this is a company that will be trading around 10$ and up to 20$ a year from now. If you are looking at this from a valuation stand point, the premium that you are looking at would be 2.500$. So the stock has a P/E of 125 and a dividend yield of 3% and a current P/E of only 3.20$. The valuation of the stock is 25$ and the current P/E is 10$. So the current P/Es for the company is 12.5$ and the valuation is 25$, which is around 15$ a share. So if you put 1.500$ in the fund, it should return 25$ a year for the next 10 years.\n",

It is very likely that the Premier account will come with a fee that exceeds 0.05% of the amount of funds transferred. I don't know of any way to reduce the fee, other than moving the money over to a different account. I'm not sure what happens when you try to transfer funds from another account. I don' know of any way that you can do this, either in an email or by contacting a customer service rep. I would not advise it as it is not worth the trouble. I've used PayPal for a couple of years, and I've never received a fee for my money in PayPal Premier.\n",

      " Answer:  I don't think it matters whether you take on the loan first or later.  I would suggest paying off the highest interest rate loan first, even if it's the most expensive.  In the case of private student loans, you will be getting into an odd situation with the federal loan limit (which is higher than your state's limit). If you have a decent credit score and good credit history, it might make sense to take on a private loan.  I think there are other advantages of taking on a loan from the federal government:\n",

      "Multi-year profit/tax question\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  It depends on how long the sale is for, if it's short term or long term, or if it is a one time sale. I'd look at this from a tax perspective.  You sell the stock for $100, you sell it for $200, you pay capital gains tax on $200. Your total gain or loss is $200 x 12, and you don't have any long term capital gain taxes, so the long term capital gain is $100 * 12 x 2.  You are in the 10% tax bracket.  You are taxed at 10% on the $200 you sell. You are in the $15000 bracket.  So you have a gain of $2000 x 24, or $200 / 12 x (12 x 10) or 2.  Your gain is $20k * 12, or $21,600.

      "What effect does a company's earnings have on the price of its stock?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  I don't think you can really determine that much from the price of a company's stock. For example, you can't tell how much stock is in the market for a company. It can be as high as the market thinks it is, or as low as the company thinks it is. The price of a company can have an impact on its ability to generate earnings. It can also have an impact on what happens when the company goes bankrupt. It can be a reflection of the company's ability to pay off debts. It can also reflect a company's debt-to-equity ratio, which can be used to determine if the company can pay off the debt. I think you should ask yourself what the company's actual earnings are, and then decide how that will influence the price of the stock. If you buy stock of a company that makes a lot of money and is also very stable, you may decide to hold on to it, because the company's earning power will keep the stock price steady. If you buy a company that makes money, you may decide not to hold on to the stock. It's a trade-off, and I think you'\n",

      "Why adjust for inflation annually, as opposed to realising it after the holding period?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  This is not an answer to your question, but rather, an answer to the question: why adjust for inflation, as opposed to just taking the inflation rate as a whole?  The main reason is that the interest rate you pay to a bond issuer is usually a relatively small amount (~0.1-0.2% depending on your bond issuer). In addition, bonds are typically sold with relatively short durations (1-2 years).  So for example, say you own a bond with a 30-year duration and a 1.25% interest rate. Your bond will likely have a 30 year duration (at 30) and you'll likely sell it for around 50% of its current value.  So, if you bought a bond with an interest rate of 3%, you'd need to pay around $140 in interest to buy a bond with a value of $120. So you'd be paying around $28 to buy a bond that will have a value of $20. That's about 0.1% annually.  So if you were to adjust the interest rate of a\n",

      "What are the tax implications on selling the Share ISA portfolio?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  I believe that you are under the impression that you will pay tax on the capital gains from selling the ISA. However, it is quite possible that you will not have to pay any tax at all, so it's worth looking at your accountant.  If your accountant says that the shares will earn you £2000 or more per year (as an ISA), then that's £200 you will have to pay in tax. It sounds like you are getting a bit of a double whammy here.  First, if the shares you are selling do in fact earn you £1500, then you will owe 15% of £150 or £15,000 on the £200.  The other thing is that you can also be left with a huge loss if you sell the shares for less than you paid for them. If your accountant thinks that your shares will earn £200 a year, then you could be left with a £500 loss and you'll still have £150 of money.\n",

      "What does it mean for a company to have its market cap larger than the market size?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  The company may have a market cap of 10 billion, but its net profit for the year would be only 50 cents. So its market cap would be only 1200000 USD.  The company would be listed as a small cap, but its market cap would still be only 510000. It's market cap is calculated by taking the number of shares of stock and dividing it by the number of shares.  For a small cap it means that the company has 12 shares of stock out of which 10 shares will be sold and 1 shares will be bought back. For a medium cap it means that they have 5 shares of stock out\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  Another thing you might want to consider is how much you plan to invest.  If you have 5% and you want to buy some more, you'll need a bigger account to do so.  If you are a saver and your money is in your IRA, you can use that money to put towards the next purchase, and not be subject to taxes on that money.  If you want to invest it, you need a bigger account for it. If you want to keep it safe and put it into a different investment, you might want to look at the other options.  The other option is to get a Roth IRA.  That is, you put money into it and you can withdraw it without taxes.  It doesn't have to be a traditional IRA.  You can also put money into it, but it's not as liquid as a Roth IRA is.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  The way you've managed to sell is very good. If you have a 30-40% loss you're on a good track to get out of it. However, you'll have to decide how you're going to manage your investment over the long term. This will require that you look at what you're doing and see if you can reduce your losses. I'm a big fan of index funds. It's easy to do the index tracking and you'll be able to pick up a decent return over time. However, I'd recommend you look at the fund performance over the last few years to see if there's something about it that you can pick up a decent performance over the long term and still be able to reduce your losses. If you're able to do so, you should sell and take a look at your portfolio to see if it still fits with your current plan. If you've already done so, then you can just keep the losses to yourself.\n",

I would be very happy if you were to invest in a stock that had no fluctuations throughout the day. You are better off.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  It's not that hard to do. The easiest thing is to hold the stock long enough for it to expire worthless, then sell a call on it, then buy a call on it.  It will have a time value of a few days, but that's just to get you into the market, if you're short, you have no time value at all. If the stock is at $5,000, and you want to sell a call, you'll have to buy a call on that stock, and then sell the call, which means you'll lose money.\n",

HFT is when someone who has never seen stock trading before, buys a stock for a small amount of money and then sells it to a person who has never seen it before. If it doesn't pay out, he buys it back at the market price (and he has to pay for it). If it does pay out, he loses a lot of money.\n",

Trades are free to the exchange if they are not made after business hours or if the exchange is closed for the night. Trades can be made at the end of a trade or if the exchange does not process a trade in a reasonable time.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I am not familiar with California, but I can tell you that the best solution is to get a loan from a credit union, with a low credit score. If you're eligible for the VA program and are in the 700-800 range, the VA will refinance your loan. This way you can get the same amount of money for the same term, and pay less interest.  The downside is that you'll be paying the higher interest rate. The VA will charge you $500-$1250 a month to help you with this.  There are also programs that are specifically geared towards helping people with bad credit histories, and these are usually only available if you are a veteran.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  A company has equity when it has ownership of at least one asset. For example, a company might have 100% ownership of a company. If a company does not have 101% ownership of a particular asset, then the company may have zero equity. A company does not have equity if it does not own any asset. The term has been used to describe the ownership of stock, the right to vote in shareholders' meetings, the right to receive dividends, the right to be paid dividends, etc. It is the case that if a company does not own at least one asset, then it does not have equities in it. If you own a company, you have equities in the company.  If the company has a stock option, then the company's equity is that part of the company that is paid in the form of shares.  If a company does have equities, then you would have equities if you own a company. If the company does not have an equity, then you do not have equities.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  If your country defaults, you may lose some or all of your money, depending on how bad it is and what the government is doing to make it worse.  For example, I'm pretty sure the US government would want to make it worse by default.  In that case, you could lose a lot of money. If you're talking about a default in the US, you'll probably lose some of your money anyway, since you'll be out of a job or unable to continue paying bills.  You could lose a little bit of money, but that's a very small risk. If the country doesn't default, then you'll have to pay more money in the short term.  For example: if you lose your job, your money won't be worth as much as it used to be.  In that scenario, you might lose some of your savings.\n",

If your question is whether to invest in index funds or a more aggressive fund, you should take a look at the fund prospectus and read the prospectus.

A proxy gives a company direct control of the stock, which can be used to buy/sell stocks on their behalf.  The proxy may be from a company that owns the company, or it could be a company which is indirectly owned by the company, such as the public company.  You may be able to use a proxy to buy the company directly, which is more secure.  You can also buy stock directly from the company, although that can be more risky.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  A 20-year term policy with a $1M death benefit costs $400/yr premium.  The 10-yr term policy has a $100/yr discount.  You are comparing a 20 year premium to a 10 year premium.   The 20 year term is typically better.  If you get a 100% return, then a 20 yr term policy is more expensive.  But the 1000% return is a good deal.  If you pay $4000/yr in premium costs for a 20y term policy, then it's a 10% discount.\n",

      " Answer:  If you're looking for a property to live in, renting a house or flat is not a good idea. If you're looking to make money from property renting, I would suggest that you consider buying a house, or a flat or a unit of property, rather. If you do this, you can invest some of your money into property investment, and then make money from the rent paid out. You will still have some money, you will have some cash, you can make a little more money. It is better to have your own place, than to rent out a house or flat.  Of course, you should always do your own research, and be sure to have a good accountant and a good lawyer.\n",

      " Answer:  This seems to be a personal situation, so I am going to give my opinion here.  I will make no recommendations, but I will offer my own experience.  I am an engineer, and have been in the field for 35 years.  I am the proud owner of a $10000 furniture package from my company.  This includes a nice desk, chairs, dining table, coffee table, 3 computer desks, 2 sofa beds, 2 recliners, and a nice TV.  The furniture is in excellent condition.  No warranty, no problem.  It has never once needed a repair, and the furniture is covered by the manufacturers warranty.  I have no plans to ever sell it.  The furnishings are a reflection of who I am.  The furnishing company is a good business, and I would never feel I was paying a higher price for their products.  In fact, I think the furniture is probably more expensive now than it was when I bought it.\n",

If you have to sell quickly and can't afford the down payment on your new house, it might make sense to refinance the existing mortgage to lower the interest rate.

You will lose your money and may end up getting sued for something like fraud and damages, and you may end up being held liable for money you are not actually responsible for. So if you have business and want to make money from it, I would recommend doing it through an account at an online brokerage. There are some brokers out there that will give you a fraction of their fees and a small amount of money for each transaction. If you have a business and you want to be paid in a timely manner, you should probably talk to your accountant and lawyer about how to do it.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  The reason why a bond's price is so high is because people believe that the interest rate will go up, which will make the bond's price go up. If you look at the price of the stock you can see that it's currently at 4%. That's why the price of a stock is currently so high. If you bought a bond at 4%, the interest rate will be 3.8% after the bond's 4% maturity.\n",

      " Answer:  I would be inclined to disagree.  The \"total stock market index fund\" is just the one stock index.  A fund of stocks is not a diversified basket of stocks.  It's a basket of stocks, but not necessarily the same stocks.  If you want to diversify your portfolio, then you need to buy a stock of each company you want to invest in.  That said, if you don't care about diversification, you could buy a few stocks of a couple companies that you know of, and put all of your investment in a single index fund.  Then when you want to buy new stocks of those companies, it will be easier for you to do that than if you had to do that for each stock you own.  If you do it all at once, then you're not diversified enough.\n",

      " Answer:  Personal umbrella insurance is a great deal for the insurance company.  They get paid a premium every time they get a claim from an insured.  They are basically making money off of the claims, and getting paid by the insurance company as well.  This means that the insurance company has a pretty large interest in having you purchase it.  The insurance company makes money off of all claims made against them, and if you get in an accident and the insurance company wins the case, you get paid a big check, and if you do get in an accident they have money to pay you back.  They do this all for the cost of the cost of a single person to represent you in court.  This means they are making money off of you.\n",

      "How can I get a mortgage I can't afford?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  I am going to assume that you are looking at a 15 year fixed rate loan at 3.75%. So the total payment for a $120,000 15 year loan would be $20,715. That's $20715/yr and the payments would be $10715. If I were in your shoes, I would take the 3.7% loan at 30 yrs. I would pay off the $120k loan in 15 years at 300% of the 3.64% loan. If you can afford to pay off the $300k loan, great. However, you will lose $100k in equity over the 15 years.\n",

The IRS will not send you a W-9. If you did not receive one from your employer, you must fill out W-9 from the IRS.  It is a good idea to have an attorney review the IRS form.  You are not required to file a W-9 if you are not self-employeed.  If you do not have a W-9, you will be audited.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  Options are a form of marketable securities, which are priced in a market in which you buy them. In this case, the option price is determined by the market price, and in the case of stock options, the price is calculated by the exchange and the broker. In the case of options, the exchange is the market maker. The exchange is typically the clearing house.\n",

      " Answer:  A stock that is 5% lower than the market is probably not doing that well.  If you want to look at the fundamentals of a company, the price of a stock is only one of the many factors you will need to evaluate to determine whether it's a good buy.  You can look at a company from a financial point of view, but it's important to consider how much of that financial data is really from the market.  If you really want to see what the company is doing in order to figure out if it's a value buy, then you can just buy the stock directly.  If you don't want to look at all the financial data, then you will be more successful by buying an index fund that will track the performance of the S&P 500.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  The short answer is \"no\".  Your credit score is a product of the sum of the factors that you are willing to accept.  If you accept a 100% increase in credit score, your score is 100%, or at least as close as you can reasonably expect to be accepted by the bank.  The best that you can hope for is that you are not subject to identity theft or some other such catastrophe that will have your credit rating seriously impacted.  If you have no other credit history, then you can probably get away with accepting the offer.  It's just that a lot of people aren't willing to accept the 100%.  You might want to consider asking for a raise, or maybe for a promotion at work, to give you more flexibility in dealing with credit issues.  But if your credit is fine, then the credit agency has to consider you a risk to them.\n",

You might be able to get a job on a contract basis, but I doubt you will be able to get that in the bank.  I don't think you should be looking at this as a financial question.  The most important thing to do here is to get your finances in order before you settle the loan.  You can start by doing this by paying off the debt you have.  If you can pay it off in full by the due date, I would suggest you do this.  However, the sooner you settle the debt, the sooner you will be able pay off the debt.  So, start paying off the credit card.  If you have the cash on hand, then do this, but I would say that the earlier you settle the higher interest rate debt the sooner you will get that loan paid off.

I don't see how you would expect them to be in perfect agreement with each other. The SPY is an S&P 500 index.  The S&P 100 is an index of stocks. The S&P index is a collection of the 500 largest companies in the U.S. It doesn't even represent all the companies that make up the S&P 200.  There is no correlation.  It is the S&P's total market cap. The SPX is just the S&P index minus the SPY.  It is also the total market cap of the 5 stocks in the S&P.  SPX and the S&P are not in perfect agreement.

If you pay off the mortgage in 15 years, you will have paid less interest on the loan than if you had paid it in 10 years. You are basically putting the house at risk of losing money that you may not be able to recover.  You have the money in your home, you are renting it out, and you are still living there.\n",

This happens to almost every car, whether it is a new luxury car or a used luxury car. If you're concerned about a car not paying for its depreciation, consider selling it and getting a new luxury or used car. It's also possible that your car is just fine and your friend bought it for a good price, which is why it is not depreciating.\n",

      "\n",

It may be the case that your wife is not legally responsible for the accident, and you're also not responsible for your spies car.  Your spouse may have no legal responsibility for the accident.  If you are responsible for your spouses car, you can take her to court and get her to pay the money.  You'll need to prove that you're not responsible for her car, and if you don't you may have to pay her any way you can.  If you aren't responsible for the accident and she isn't legally responsible for it, you may be able to get her to sign over ownership to you if you agree to pay the full cost.\n",

      " Answer:  You need to be sure that the price of your stocks are correct.  There's no point in buying stock that is trading at a loss.  That is, if you buy it at $10, then your profit is $10000.  If you buy it at 50 cents per share, you've made a profit of $5000, which is not much.  So, if you buy at $10 you'll end up with a loss of $50,009.  That's why it's a good idea to hold onto stock until it's sold.\n",

The above chart is showing the best case scenario where you get back 24% of your initial amount, i.e. 15% per year. So this is a return of 50% / 20% / 15% = 24% per year.\n",

If it is down, you are basically saying \"I think the stock is going down\". The price action is also important to the options strategy, so a call at the current price is usually good. If the stock is going in a downward direction, it is a bad idea to buy the option at the current stock price, unless you think the stock price will fall more in the future.\n",

Some of these people make a lot of money, and some of them make very little. But the key is the money they put in and the investment they take.  If you can't get a job, or you want to retire, or want to build up a family, or you want a new house or a rental property or whatever. You can invest your money in a house, or you can invest in the stock market. You can invest in a business, or you can put your money in a stock market fund. If you have a lot of money and can invest it, then you can put it in an ETF, like the S&P 500, and that ETF will go up.

      " Answer:  You can look at a CD, and a savings account. They both have different interest rates and risk. You can find this information on the banks site. I would also suggest that you look at a CD that earns a higher interest rate. I would also look at a savings account that earns a better interest rate than your CD. That way, you can use the CD to earn more money than you could on your savings account. Also, you can check out the CD rates offered by your bank to see if you can get better rates.\n",

Gold, unlike other metals, does not have a hard or soft spot and is not affected by humidity or temperature. The quality of the metal also makes no difference. If the jewelry is good condition, it is worth selling. If you don't like the condition, it is not worth selling. I have seen people buy jewelery that was bad condition and sell it.\n",

If the borrower is underwater and the Bank feels it is not consistent with the loan contract they will have to refinance the loan or the Bank will foreclose on the property. This will usually be a few days after the loan is due to be paid off. The interest rate is determined by the Bank and is not the same as the interest rates of other loans such as a credit card or mortgage. If you can't find a good interest rate online, call your bank and ask for a referral to a mortgage lender who will help you get the best rate.\n",

In the UK at least there are quite a few such funds that pay dividends, and can even be invested directly in your local bank.  If you have a decent-sized deposit in the UK Savings Bank, it is possible to open a CD-based savings account and invest directly in stocks and ETFs.  If you're not a regular user of your bank's online banking, you might also be able to set up a CD-based account through your local bank. I personally would never set up a CD in the UK.

They are not very different from a basket of commodities, except that they are not the same thing as the stock market.  If you were to ask an investor what the best way to do this is, they would probably tell you to buy a couple of different stocks and try to keep them from moving too much together.  But that is a lot easier said than done. If you have no other asset class to use to make your bets, it is a good idea to diversify, and the best way to get that is to invest in a variety of asset classes.\n",

Their resumes were written for the company to show off their abilities.  The salesman had to take this knowledge and run with it.  I have heard that salespeople who are good at social media are good at selling.  That is true, but it's a very small percentage of sales people.  It's a small part of the business.  It'll be very small percentage of the company. You also have to understand that most salespeople are not interested in working in this industry.

If you don't care about this sort of thing, then look at their performance history. If you can't find this, then I think you need to look at what people are talking about when they say that mid-cap stock perform better than large-cap stocks. If you can find these people, then you can see that there's no correlation between performance and size.  It's not about size, it's about the relative strength of the companies that are going to pay dividends and pay out cash. That's a very big deal.  I don't know how much you're willing to invest, but it would be really easy to invest a bunch of money and have a bad year. The stock market can get pretty nasty if you try.

The problem is that you cannot predict the future of a stock, and if you are trying to predict the future of stocks, you will almost certainly end up in the wrong place.  The only thing you can do with stock is sell when you think the stock is too expensive.  If you feel that a stock is too expensive, and are willing to sell it, then by all means, do so.

      "Selling mutual fund and buying equivalent ETF: Can I 1031 exchange?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  Yes you can sell an ETF and buy equivalent securities.  However the ETF will be less liquid and will not be the same as the securities in the mutual fund.  This is because ETFs and mutual funds have different holdings that they have to make their holdings liquid.  So if your ETF has a lot of positions in the stock market you will lose liquidity of your ETF, so you can't just hold it in your ETF.\n",

If you're looking for some information on how low interest rates work in the US, you can find the answers on the Federal Reserve website: http://www.fed.us/inflation/inflation-monitor.html  In short, interest rates are low in the US because the Federal Reserve is not buying bank deposits. Instead, it is buying government bonds to keep the economy afloat. As an aside, in the EU, interest rates are not as low. I would not expect this to change, though, because the government is still buying government bills.\n",

It's a debt that is going to be a long term debt, if you pay it off in a timely manner, and you make the payments on time, it will go away.

I can imagine the situation where you are a high earner and your spouse earns $100,000 per year. The standard deduction on your standard deduction would be $10,006. The standard exemption on your standard exemption would be $50,005. If your spouse is a higher earner, he or she could deduct the $10,500.

This way, you can be diversified if you have the desire to be, or you can always sell and re-buy when you want to.  Investing in stocks can be risky and unpredictable, and you can get scammed a lot. If you have a bit of time, you can also do some stock market play, by investing in small cap stocks (or even just in the stock market as a whole).  The downside of doing this is that you have to have a long time horizon to be able to make some money, and there is some risk involved in doing this.

You may want to invest in a tax-deferred 401 (either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA), if your tax bracket is high enough.  A Roth IRA can only be used to purchase a mutual fund and a single stock fund (no more).  I personally think that it's too risky and the return is not worth the hassle.\n",

So if the market opens at 9:00 AM and you have a stop loss at 9:20 AM, then your stop loss would trigger 9:09 AM. So if the markets opens at 9 AM you would have to have a stop loss trigger at 9 AM. If the markets opens after 9:01 AM and you have the stop loss at 8:59 AM then you would have to trigger it at 8:49 AM. It is a bit hard to explain what is going on, so just try to think of it as a limit order. You would put in a limit order at 9:30 AM, but it will not trigger a stop loss until 9:05 AM.\n",

      " Answer:  This is an important question.  I would like to know how to answer it. First, I will tell you what the consolidation is worth to you.  1) Shareholders with large positions will be diluted by the consolidation, and will have to pay more than their fair value to the shareholders of other companies. I'll give an example.  So, say you own 1 share in a company called 'A', and they issue a stock dividend of $1.00 per share for the year.  Now you own 2 shares in A, and now they have a $1.01 dividend.  You will be $1.03 poorer, but you will still be a shareholder.  2) Shareholders who own 2 shares (either A or B) in the company will get the same amount of money as before.  Now they will only have to pay $1.04 each, rather than $1.05.  They will be worth less, but still worth it. 3) Shareholders of companies with more than 20% of a company's shares will receive less, as the\n",

You can buy a house with a lower price than the market will be when you move out. It also won't cost you much more than the mortgage on the condo. You can do the same thing with a flat.

However, if you are trading on margin, you may be required to do so. If you do short sell a stock, then you are taking on a risk of selling a stock for less than you actually own it. You are taking on a possible 100% loss, or more. You can't sell your stock, you have to short it. The same way you would short a bond. So you are taking on more risk.

If I buy shares of stock and it goes up I don't need to worry about it. But I would say that I have been lucky in that I have never had a stock go down. I have had the stock drop 30% but not once. I would be happy if I could have done this 200 times.\n",

In the US, 3.5% for 30 year is pretty low.  If you are looking at 15 year, that is 4% interest.  So it's probably a good idea to hold off.

This is the same thing as the negative interest rate that banks offer on mortgage loans. It's the bank's way of calculating the risk they have to assume if they lend you the money.  They will have to assume that you will default on the loan and have to pay interest on the savings they have put in to you.

      " Answer:  I know this is a bit late, but I wanted to answer your question: \"How can I make sure that my retirement is not spent in a developing country?\"  There are a few things that you can do to ensure that you do not spend your retirement in a developing country.  First, try to get out of debt.  Even in poorer countries, you will still have debt.  Pay it off early, so you are not paying interest.  That will make sure that you do not end up in debt and unable to retire in a developing country, which can be a very difficult thing to do.  Also, there is an argument that debt is a form of government intervention.  There is some truth to that, but in many countries the government has no incentive to do so.  This can be a reason for people to take on debt, which can result in them not getting the retirement that they want.   If you can, you should try to get your money out of the developing country, and into the country you want to live in.

I don't know about the US, but in the UK, the lender is required to show the size of the mortgage to the buyer, which is then used to calculate the amount you need to pay, and so you're not overcharging them. It is a very old system. I think the lender should always try to give the buyer a good idea of the cost of the mortgages they are buying.

I know there are some good answers here about the other things, but if you have a freelance business or you are looking for a freelance gig, I think that being a freelancer will probably be better than being a CTO.\n",

      " Answer:  This question isn't really about the crash. It is about the investing strategy that investors adopted. In general, many mutual funds had a lot of stocks that they bought during the bust.  They were also in the S&P 500. I had a fund in 2010 that had the S&P500. It was a large fund.

      " Answer:  Invest in a mutual fund. You pay no money to the fund for investing. It will grow, and if the stock market goes up, you get a better return. If you buy individual stocks, you'll get the same return as the mutual fund.  But you do pay fees, and they're tax deductible.  If you don't want to do that, you'll just buy a mutual fund and put all your money into it. If you do decide to put all your money in a mutual funds, you can buy individual stocks.  There are also many different investment vehicles that are available. For example, if you invest in the stock market, you can put your money into individual stocks, mutual funds, or even in a mix of investment vehicles.  This will give you a higher rate of return.\n",

      " Answer:  First of all, I'd like to say, I think the fact that you're considering gold as an investment is a good sign. You can certainly make money on gold. I'd like a few points of clarification.  You're looking at a 1% return on $100k. This is not an insane return. The question you have asked is great, and I'm glad you asked. I don't have a good answer for the fact that you don't need $100K to get a return on your gold. I'll just throw it out there: If you are looking to invest 1% in gold, you're doing it wrong. You are paying too much in commissions to do this. It's a great idea to buy physical coins, but it's a great way to go if you have $1000 to start with.  The key to gold is not gold. You are looking to buy physical copper and use that as an investment. I'd go with gold over copper, but I'd still look at it. If you have $1k to invest, you'\n",

      " Answer:  I am assuming you mean a tax return. If you are working for a business and you are in California, then you would need to have your return mailed to California. If you are not working for a business, you would have to pay taxes on income you generate in a foreign country, even if you are not physically present. It is not clear what purpose you have for being in California. If you have an income from California, you can deduct California taxes on your return. If you work for a foreign company, and you are a citizen of the United States, you are required to file your return on schedule C, and California taxes are not deducted from your income. You may have a business in other states, and you would need to pay taxes from that state, even if you do not work there.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I believe you're confusing the two. The Protected Equity Loan (PEL) is a debt, a loan you make to a corporation. You pay interest on the debt until you're debt free.  The Protected Equities Loan (PEL) is a loan you make from your equity. You pay interest for the loan until you're in debt, or until you're out of debt. You can't get a PEL from a bond or a bond fund. If you can, the bond is protected and you get a loan from a bond fund. In general, it's more expensive.  In short, you're paying interest on the debts you take out. If you have a loan from your equity, you get money from your equity (i.e. you get interest from the loan).  A PEL is just a loan. You get interest from the bank or from the bond fund.\n",

It is a common mistake for people to think that they can just pay off their card, and they don't need to do anything. It's true, you can't just pay off the card. You need to pay it off. If you are paying interest, you need to take the time to pay it off, as it will add a lot of extra interest to your balance. The amount that you can afford to pay off depends on your income and your expenses, and you may be able to pay off the debt early.\n",

If you have a job, you are not necessarily limited to just working in real estate.  You could also be a teacher, waitress, etc. It is also possible to have your business fail.  The mortgage market is just as good as any other.  The mortage market is also the same way that it was before the housing crash.  You are not always better off.  In a lot of cases, the only thing you can really do is keep your costs down so you are not paying more in interest.  And make sure that you pay off your loan as quickly as you can.  You don't want to pay more interest than you have to, which means paying down the loan early.  That could be bad for you.\n",

      " Answer:  It's a term that is thrown around a lot. It is defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission as follows: Insider trading occurs when an insider of an organization, or a group of individuals who are insiders of an organization, knowingly or recklessly: A person who is insider of a company that makes, sells or purchases securities is an insider of that company and may be subject to the Securities Act of 1933.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  As per IRS Publication 492, IRS publication 15-F has a page that explains how to calculate estimated taxes. It goes on to say:  If the taxpayer is not self-employed, the   estimated tax payment must be estimated from 1940 or later   and must include the amount of income, not just the amount reported by the   employer. If the employer has provided a 1096 return,   the taxpayer must estimate taxes based on that return.  For taxpayers   with estimated taxes, the amount of tax paid is   based on the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the   property or the total of the taxpayer\n",

      "I am sure I am not the first to get this answer but if I have 1098 income for the previous year and I have only 988 to go to the IRS this is the first thing I will do. I am not an accountant but I would expect that the IRS has a procedure whereby they can go through a spreadsheet and calculate your taxes. If I remember correctly, it takes you a while\n",

      "Why should we expect stocks to go up in the long term?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  If I'm an investor, I would expect stock prices to be up.  But I also expect stock prices to go down.  So why not be an optimist and hope for the best?  The optimist's answer: if you are an investor, the stock market is a game of supply and demand.  When supply and demand are high, prices go up.  When demand is high, prices go down.  In general, stock prices go up when supply and demand are low.  The opposite is true for stock prices to go up when demand is low.  So you should expect prices to go up if supply and demand are strong.  If they're not strong, expect prices to go down if supply and demand is weak. The question of whether prices go up is hard to answer.  If demand is high, you should expect prices in the 20s to go up.  If demand goes down, you should expect that prices go down. In any case, if prices go up, they will go up.  But prices will go up and down all the time.  If they go up, they may go down.\n",

      " Answer:  The IRS has a nice fact sheet on this site, including a link to the full text of 1040ES.  It seems like this is a bit of a mess.  The IRS says that there are two issues with this:  The first is the fact that it is a wash sale.  This means you can sell the stock and not pay tax on the gain.  The second issue is the wash sale. The IRS says this is where you would not be able to sell your shares.  You would need to use a wash sale to reduce the gain to zero. The IRS has a fact sheet that has the entire process laid out.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I am not sure, but I think it has something to do with your payment history. If you've never missed a payment, and you never pay your balance in full every month, then you don't really have a history. If you miss a payment, and your balance is late for at least 12 months, you can still be late. It might be better to pay your balance in half and pay it off in full in one go. I am not sure, though, if it's true that your history is \"mostly\" a record of your current balance. If you have no history, and no payments, then you can't say you have \"credit\" - because you can't show up to pay off your credit card balance at all.\n",

It is a bad idea to put your credit score at risk to get a mortgage.  Your credit score will get affected by your credit score, and you will be subject to higher interest rates for a variety of reasons.  If you are getting approved for a mortgage and PMI is not a factor, then you can save a lot of money by not getting a mortgage with PMI.  The mortgage companies would rather see your score go up than go down.  If you can get approved for a mortage with PMI, you will be subjected to higher interest rates on your mortgage.\n",

      " Answer:  This is a very good question and I'll try to answer it as best as I can.  There is no single right answer, but you need to take a look at the facts and circumstances in your situation and ask yourself:  How much are you willing to pay to get the peace of mind of knowing you have a fixed monthly payment for a long term?  If you have the ability to save money over the course of 30 years, I'd stick with a fixed-rate mortgage and put some of the savings towards your down payment.  If you don't have the ability to do so, you may want to consider a variable-rate mortgages.  If you have an option to pay off the mortgage early, I'd choose to pay off the early payment.  In my area, we have a mortgage on our primary residence and have never missed a payment, and it's been a pretty good deal.\n",

      " Answer:  I've looked at it and it seems to be the case.  Retail investors do exist, and they do buy stocks on the stock market.  It's just that they have a harder time doing so than other investors because they have more time to research the stocks and know what they're buying.  They also have a lot of leverage which makes them more vulnerable to losses, especially in retail stocks.  Retail stocks also have higher volatility, but they are also a lot less risky than stocks in general.\n",

      " Answer:  I would like to point out that you need to know what you are doing. If you are selling options, you are selling your position in the underlying asset, not a derivative. It is a very good thing you are taking this approach, because you are going to end up with the same position.  You have to remember that you will only be selling the stock at the end of the day if the option expires worthless.  If you want to buy a stock at the end and have it be worthless at the end, you will have to take a position in the underlying security. If you want to make a profit from the options, you are going to have to hold the stock for 6 months.  You will not have the option expired worthless at the time you sell it.

Second, and this is not an answer to the question but is what you want to ask, the credit card is a business card. The business card is issued by a business and the business will never pay you back, even if you have the money and the receipt for the money.

This is typically used by people with a \"stuck up attitude\" that they don't feel comfortable with their financial position. The reason this is used is that they feel they can't be debt free because the only reason for them to do so is to \"feeling comfortable\". It's easy to feel comfortable if you're financially comfortable. However, that is not the best reason to be debt free. Debt is a bad way to get money that you don't have to spend. The only way to do that is to work extra jobs. Debt is an emotional way to get money. It is a bad way of getting money that you don;t need.\n",

      "Please explain: What exactly is a CDS or “Credit Default Swap”?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  This is a type of CDS that is used when a financial institution has a large exposure to securities and is concerned about how these securities may be affected by a bankruptcy. It is a derivative of a bond or a CD. A CDS is essentially a form of insurance on a bond, which is used to offset the risk of loss for an insurance company. A CDS allows the issuer of the bond to take out a loan against it and recover the amount of the loan. As a result, the issuer of a CDS has the potential to recover their money if the issuer of another bond defaults on the loan, which in this case would be the issuer of this one. It is very important to understand the risks and responsibilities of the issuer of CDS in this scenario. It is very possible for a CDS to have the issuer go bankrupt. It is not uncommon for a CDS issuer to fail.\n",

      " Answer:  First and foremost, learn about personal finance.  You don't want to be the guy that gets into financial trouble.  The best way to start out is to learn about investments.  I'd suggest looking into the following: The stock market is a very risky investment, but it can be an extremely rewarding investment.  It's a great way to make money and to save a ton of money.  You could invest $1,000 into the stock market for $1,050, and end up with a lot more than $1,025.  I think that you can start out investing by picking stocks that you think are good, buying them and then selling them when you feel like it.  This is great practice because you will be investing in the company and the company's future.  If you feel like you need to start out with a lot of money to invest, then you can invest in a mutual fund.  If you are a very young person, you should probably not invest in individual stocks.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  You can sell your house for 2-3 times the value of the house. This would not be a bad idea, but you will have to make some money. You can sell your home for less than 25% of the market price. It can be done if you sell quickly and for a good price. It is important to get a good price to sell your house quickly.  The reason for selling quickly is that if you are a good buyer, you can get the house for 100% of the value.  A good deal of people are selling their houses at a loss. That is fine, but you will need to keep the cash. You could sell a house at 25% loss.  You might be surprised that it is possible to sell at 100%, but I would expect that to be very difficult.  If you can get the money for a good price, sell it quickly. It is good for your long term financial future.\n",

The biggest is that there is a lot of complexity in the way people think about credit scores. I would suggest that there is no one right way to score, but there are many things that have different opinions on how to score. There is also the issue of how to use a credit card.  Most people don't have a good understanding of what the scoring system is. In the end, the only way I've found to use it was to use the online service and use the credit score as I did.

      " Answer:  I have heard of people who are renting their parents' house for a few years, but not the whole story.  My parents are in their mid-forties.  We paid $25,000 for a house that had been listed on the market for 3 months.  I did all the work on the house and paid all the bills.  It has been about 15 months now and we are paying about $1500/month.  They still pay us $2500.  The down payment was 20%.  They have not been paying us any rent.  This is not a scam.  It is a way for them to pay off their debts.  They are not paying the mortgage.  The bank has paid $5000 in interest.  It is $200/month or about $2000/year.  The $500 is on the mortgage, so they don't even get a cent of that money.  They still have a few more years to save up.  That is why I said that you shouldn't be worried.\n",

The tenant should have been given notice of what happened and given a deadline to take action. The landlord may have had to pay for the damage. If you have a mortgage and are not on it, you may be able to apply for a mortgage extension if you can show that the landlord failed to take reasonable action.

For those who rent, it is a capital gain, so you can capitalize that income by investing the money in a mutual fund.  But for most people, owning a home is not worth the tax savings.  And if you have kids who are at college or who are renting, you will likely have to put in the effort to keep up with the mortgage payments.  Buying a house is a good investment if you are willing to put in the extra effort.\n",

      " Answer:  The answer to this question depends on the type of work you are doing, your current salary, and the tax bracket that you are in.  As a contractor, the question is whether you can get the same type of work done for less money.  You should look at the following: You might want to look at the \"Walk-In\" type of contract.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I know this is a lot to ask, but here is the answer: The answer to this question is a definite \"no\" because you cannot use your house as a principal residence.  There are a few exemptions for this purpose.  You can use your home as your principal residence if you rent it out to your family and you are still a tenant.  You can also use it as your principal residence even if you live there and rent it out. The rules are different depending on whether you rent it out for short term or for longer term use.  If you rent it out at least 25% of the year it is considered your principal residence. If you rent it for more than 25% the year it is your principal residence you will not be able to use it as your primary residence.  However, if you rent it for less than 25%, and you live there for 25% or less of the year, you can still use it as your prime residence if you can get the property inspection for free and you are willing to live there for the rest of the year.

      "What is a Student Loan and does it allow you to cover a wide range of expenses relating to school?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  I'm assuming that you are in the US. The most important factors in determining the value of the loan will depend on the type of loan, but the most common type of loan is a federal Direct Loan. This loan can be used to finance college, a degree program, or even graduate school. This loan has a minimum of 120% of your federal income tax rate. For example, in 2015, the federal minimum was 35% for all income taxes, and in 2009, the minimum was 32%. So, the minimum amount of federal tax to be paid is $21,400, which is $1000 per year for the 120K. If you were to get into a 200K loan, the interest rate would be about 3% higher, but if you are eligible for FAFSA and/or SATS, you can reduce your loan payment by paying extra. So, in theory, you could pay off $3200 in student loan debt with 200% of federal taxes, but in reality, this is very\n",

      " Answer:  I think it depends on your bank, but most credit card issuers will charge a fee to you if you do not use the card for a month.  You will also need to pay the transaction fees to the bank.  That is what they call the \"interchange fee\" for debit cards. The difference between the \"interchange\" fees and the \"credit card processing fee\" is small enough that you will not notice.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  This is a little tricky.  You need to be careful to determine if you are getting a loan or not.  Someone could write a check, but that will get the money to the lender.  A loan is a loan.  If they are using your account as a loan to get the money, then they are not borrowing money to you. They are just borrowing money to the bank. The only way to get out of a loan is to stop making payments.  If they can't get the money they are borrowing, then they are going to go bankrupt.  If they don't have money to pay you back, then you are out of luck. If they are making payments to the bank, then they are still going to make payments, and they will pay you back. You will just not be able to afford the house.  You might have to find a different bank.  Some banks are very good about getting out of loans early.  You might want to check that.  You might also be able to find a bank that doesn't require you to have a loan, and that you can afford.\n",

If you exercised a call option and the underlying stock was not bought by you at the time you exercised the option, then you will not be able to exercise the call option and will have to settle it. If the underlying stock is bought by you at that time, then you will be able to exercise and buy it. This is an option not a call option. The only option you will be able buy is the option to exercise the call.  If you exercise a call option you are basically exercising a call and you will have to settl the call.  This is how it is used by investors to take a long position. If you have not exercised the call and you are long a call option you will still be able to exercise it.\n",

      " Answer:  In most 401K plans, if a participant dies the beneficiary's account is closed.  If the beneficiary dies and his or her plan is inactive, the account is closed.   However, if a person is inactive for one year or more, the plan can re-open.   The account is then closed and the participant's name cannot be added to the account.  If a person dies and his or hers account is inactive for a year, the plan may re-open.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  One of the things I find interesting about these answers is that people are generally not aware of the \"dollar amount of loss\" or the fact that they are insured.  I recently did an insurance claim for my home that was not my fault, and they were willing to cover 30K.  So it was not a \"loss\" but rather a \"dollar amount\".  I asked about the deductible, and they explained it as the insurance company being happy to take on such a loss.  In the end, I was happy to have the insurance.\n",

      " Answer:  I've been following the advice here to use a low-cost index fund (like the Vanguard Low-Cost Index) and buy individual stocks on margin.  My question is, if I do this will I ever need a second job? If so, and the stock market goes down, is there a way I can offset that?  In my mind I'd rather lose a few hundred dollars a month by owning individual stocks than a single stock.  The market doesn't move much, and I don't really care if I'm not making much.  I can always put some of my money in a bank account or I can do this with a brokerage account.\n",

      "If stock price drops by the amount of dividend paid, what is the use of a dividend\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  Dividends are paid to shareholders of companies that trade on a stock exchange.  Some companies may not have dividend payments for the year and dividends may not be paid to their shareholders.  So the shareholders of such companies may not get dividends.  For example, many US companies do not pay dividends.  This is because they may be paying dividends for the first time and may not have a large share of their earnings held by investors. If a company is paying dividends, it's because it's choosing to pay the dividends.  It's also because it's looking to make the company more attractive to potential new investors.  It may not have been paying dividends and may have made the stock price drop as a result.\n",

      " Answer:  It appears you are in the United States. In the US, assets and liabilities are treated as if they were the same thing, so you have to look at the value of the liability. For example, you could have the car you are driving now, and the liability was the amount you paid in order to get it. But if the liability is $200,000, then it would be $200k in assets. You could then sell the car, and pay $18k for the liability. If the liability is less than $200K, then the car is still yours, you just can't sell it, so you would have to pay it off.\n",

If you buy a $20 stock at $10 per share, you'll get a return of $1.  If the stock falls to $9, then you pay the $1000 borrowed to the lender.  If the company goes bankrupt, you'll lose your money.

The broker is not authorized to do that, so you cannot use such a practice.  Also, if your brokerage firm is not authorized, you cannot have access to the funds held in the account.  This is true for HFT.  The other method that you might find that you can use is to trade with your broker, and then use a brokerage firm to place your order.  This is what was done by JP Morgan, for example.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I am not sure that the \"highest quality\" can be found in the retail stores.  In fact it is not necessarily possible.  For example if you want a nice, comfortable shirt, the quality of the shirt will not be determined by the retailer.  If you buy the shirt from the local store, you are more likely to find it good, but if you shop from the internet, you will find that the quality of the item is not as high as you think it is.  And that's not even the only way you can find a quality shirt.  You could also try the \"sportswear\" stores or \"athletic\" stores, or even just go to the local mall.  But in these cases you would likely have to go for something that is not that fashionable.  I am sure you will find that it is not that expensive.  And if you buy a shirt that is not that cheap, you might just end up with a bad shirt.   Also, there is a possibility that the retailer might have a problem.

      "When investing, is the risk/reward tradeoff linear?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  The problem with linear risk/reward is that it is too easy to see that a trade is going in the right direction or the wrong direction when you look at it from the point of view of the investor. For example, you are buying a stock and the stock price drops 25% and you are buying more shares in order to keep up with the stock price.  In that case, you are not seeing that a stock price has gone down.  Instead you are looking at a trade that you have made because you have decided that the stock price is going up.  This is not a trade you would make if you had simply seen the stock price go up or down by 25%. You are buying more stock and more shares, which is probably going to go up and down as the price goes up or down.  The risk of this is that the stock price may go up and down at different times, or go up and down in different ways.  So if the stock price goes up, you are buing more shares and you are selling more shares, which means that you have lost money.  If the stock price goes down, you are selling shares and you are bu\n",

Your brother is not obliged to pay for the house, but you will get to stay there as long as you can stay for your brother's benefit, and as long as he is not planning to move in with you. As he will need to pay for the mortgage it is very unlikely that he will move out of your brother' s home without paying rent for a few years at least.

If you can afford to pay for that home out of savings or money market, and have good credit you may be able to negotiate a mortgage with the bank. I have a friend that had a 100K house and they were trying to sell it, they could have had it appraised for 200K. They didn't have a contract, and didn't know the house was underwater. I helped them, and we got a loan, it was a $20K loan, which was $150K in cash. I am sure they could have done the same thing if they wanted.\n",

That's good, but not really an issue if you just want to buy and hold. Second, if you look at the dividend yields, they have been going up and up and up.  This is not unheard of.  In the 1920's, they were very high.  It wasn't just dividends, it was also inflation.  You can see the effects of these things in stock prices, and in bonds.  It seems you have two investment vehicles:  Dividends are not a great way to make money.  I would suggest you put money into something like an S&P550 index fund or ETF.  If you have the discipline to hold and invest a lot of time, then the dividends are not too bad.  You will be surprised how much you make by putting money into these.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  There are two common solutions I know of. The first is to open a business account with a bank in the US. You can use the US business account (usbusiness.us) as your business account. If you do this, it can be very helpful for you as you can make payments to your business account from your home country, so you will not have to travel to the US to make payments. You can also apply for an Employer Identification number (EIN) for your business account. This is usually only useful for businesses that have a large turnover of revenue (over $100K) so it is not something you can just get on a business card. You can also use your business account as your sole employee. This is a way to keep your business separate from your personal life, so you will only be taxed on your personal income.\n",

Your best bet would be to pay it all off now.  You need to pay it off, but pay it off.  It sounds like you have a job that you need to be paid for.  If you want to be paid, you need to be on time and pay your debts.  If you don't have a job, then you will be in a hard situation.  You are paying yourself in a way that is unethical and unacceptable to the law.  If the law doesn't care, then the only thing that you can do is pay off your debts.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  You are basically making a decision to pay less interest on the debt. If the interest rate is 0% for a year, and you pay it off, then you get 1% back on your loan, or $12.25 per month, but that's a $2500 dollar difference in the rate of return. You get $12,250 back over a year, but the $12,000 in interest is gone. If you have the option, you might be better off just keeping the money and paying off the loan at 1% interest over the year. If you are trying to make sure you will pay off the loan in a timely fashion, you might try to pay off the loan as soon as possible.\n",

      "Can rent be added to your salary when applying for a mortgage?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  This depends on the mortgage company.  It's called the \"qualifying nature\" of your rent.   The qualifying nature of your rent is the money you pay towards the mortgage.   The amount of your rent is added to your gross income, and is the amount you pay towards the loan.  The amount you pay is based on how much the company feels your rent is worth.   So for example, if you pay $1000/month for 25 years and you pay $1500/month to the bank, the mortgage lender can say \"Okay we think your rent is worth $16000.  That is how much you can pay towards the loan.\" If you are the type of person that pays more towards your mortgage, that is more than likely a good thing.  The money you pay towards your mortgages is money you are putting towards the house, not your salary.\n",

      "Why are real-term bond yields systematically declining, and what does it mean for investors?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  There are a number of issues with the argument that interest rates are lower now.  This is the best summary of it from a financial perspective.  Interest rates are not only the interest rate for loans, but also for savings accounts, etc.   So, even if the rate is lower, you should still expect a decline in yields.  The rate on savings accounts is typically a good reflection of interest rates.  The rate to pay a 30 year bond would be higher than to pay a 10 year bond, as the 10 year is the longer term.  The 30 year is the short term, and has a shorter maturity.  So, the 30 year yields are lower.  If you put a $100K bond at 4% interest, the yield will be about $15K, but the 10Y will be about $400K.  This means that interest rates are falling, which is a good thing.  This is also why rates are falling.\n",

You can sell it when it is up to your desired return.  In my opinion, it's more important that you do not get emotional and try to rush the process.  It takes a while to build up your equity and to get a good return on your money.  A 10 year investment is worth 2% in real estate.

      "Why would a car company lend me money at a very low interest rate?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  I don't see why it is a bad thing. You're not going to be able to buy a car from a bank or finance company at a bad interest rate, even if you have a large down payment.  If you are able to finance with a loan from your bank, you may be able to do better financing on your next loan.  The problem is that your next loan is more expensive.  If you buy a car with cash, you don't have a loan on that car. You don't have to deal with the paperwork, insurance, maintenance, etc of a loan on a car. You can sell the car with cash for the amount of money you want, and you can pay the loan off sooner.  You're just making more money.  And you don't really have to sell it until you're in a place where you're going to need the money sooner.  In the U.S., we have the option of a car payment in the 5% range, which makes the decision of whether to make the payment to make the car payment worthwhile.\n",

Second, if you really are trying to get a sense of whether you should buy a credit card or not, you should probably talk to a professional about it. If you can get a free credit report and can do it yourself, you'll probably not get a free card from them anyway. But you'll be much more careful about what you buy. You should also look at whether you should just go for it. I don't think you should just go with it. If you do end up with one of those, you'll be glad you did.\n",

That may be due to the fact that the rate on their card was much lower than what they'd have paid if they paid the minimum. I would expect that to be true for most people.  It doesn't really have much to do with the card issuer, the bank, or the credit card issuers, as all of those have their own interest rates. The only way for the credit card issuer to reduce the interest rate is to simply change the rate.\n",

You don't have enough cash to live on for the long term. 2) You want to avoid selling a company you don't want in the stock market. You want to avoid being stuck with the company for the next 10 years.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I've had many banks, and I've never seen a transaction that I could not perform on the internet. I've used credit cards, bank of America, and a variety of other banks. I have never had a problem with banks in general. I've had banks that require you to sign paperwork before opening a new account. But the banks that have the lowest transaction fees are the ones that I would expect to have a good reputation with the consumer. I think the main reason that banks make money is that you sign up for it. It is part of their business model. I think it is just that you are signing up for it, and it is part of the business model.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  There are many reasons, but the main is the convenience. Most people who don't use credit cards just use debit cards, and most people who do use debit cards are not using it for any reason. Credit cards are easier to use and have better security, and they have better terms, so they can be used for a lot of things, like shopping, and for many other purposes.  I think the best reason to use a credit card is to avoid late fees.  Many companies have discounts that are good only when used in the store, and if you use the card at a store, you can usually get the discount for a while.\n",

Your stock is now in a position where you are trying to figure out if the discount you are willing to pay is worth it.  You are also considering the possibility that the stock may go back up if the company is undervalued.  You want to see if you can make more money.  That is what you are trying to do.

I don't think that there is a national minimum for child support, and if there is there would be a federal law that requires it.  I don;t know about the state of California.  I think it is the same thing in all states.   It seems you are paying for college and you need a place to live, so I would guess that if you are living on campus you are paying the full tuition.  If you are living on the street, I would think that you would be paying for that too.   If you are living off campus, then I would say that you are living beyond your means.  Your dad probably lives in the area.  So I would say that he should have taken some kind of action that would have made his income more manageable, and he should have taken care of his finances so that he would be able to pay his bills.

In the revised form, the RSU is taxed as a loss and you have to pay tax on it as a gain. In practice, most RSUs are withheld on a Form 1040, and you can calculate your basis based on that.\n",

It is a bit unusual for a call option to be in the money at expiration, but that is a fairly rare occurrence for a put option. The option buyer is trying to sell the option because they don't believe it will be worth the premium that the option buyer is paying.  If the option buyer thinks the underlying security will fall, the premium is a bit higher, but not much.\n",

You may want to buy shares in their IPO, or you may want to sell your shares and invest elsewhere. That's all just speculation, but it's all worth looking at.

      " Answer:  There is a very common misconception about TFSA's being used as a place for you to put away a lump sum. In reality you can't put away a lunchbox full of cash at a TFSA. You can't get a direct deposit at the bank from a TFSA, and you cannot put your money in at all. Instead, you invest it in a savings account or other asset that will grow. That is a place where the interest can come from.  TFSA'\n",

      "I'm thinking of getting a new car … why shouldn't I LEASE one?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  You're asking a very valid question. It's the same question as when you ask if you should buy a new car. You need to consider: How long do you plan on driving the car? How do you feel about buying a new car? What do you need the car for? You might have to decide between buying a new vehicle and a lease vehicle.  If you decide to lease, you're paying a huge premium over a new car for that period. I'd go with leasing over buying a new one. I'd consider how long you want to keep the car. Is it 10 years? 20 years? 50 years? 100 years?  What kind of car do you want? Do you need an all-wheel drive vehicle? A diesel vehicle? A hybrid vehicle? A truck? A SUV? Do you plan on moving to another city?  If you're driving 500 miles to visit family or a friend, you might want to lease.  If you'll only be driving to work and back for a few years, you'll be fine leasing.\n",

If the wash sale rule was applied to you in the previous year, you would have to do the wash sale and sell all of your stocks. If the wash wash sale is not possible, then you have to hold on to your original stocks and sell them when the wash sale is no longer possible. If you are selling your stock in the US, you must sell the stock within 30 days of the wash sale date.  This is different from the wash sale rules, which apply to stocks you sell in the EU or other countries.  See the US Wash Sale Rule for details.\n",

The key one is to make sure that you do not run afoul of a foreign bank's anti-fraud regulations.  If you have a foreign account, you should make sure that you have an account number that is not already on file with the bank.  You will want to make sure that it is not an uncommon occurrence for you to have an account number for a bank that you don't want to be listed on your passport.

      " Answer:  Stock prices are determined by the open interest in a market at any given time. The opening bid and the opening ask are the price of the last trade on the stock, and the closing bid and closing ask are the price on the next day. Open interest is measured by the number of buyers and sellers on the last trade. For large market caps the number of buy and sellers is much more complicated, because the market cap is much more complicated. A stock may have a lot of buyers and a lot of sellers, or it may have many buyers and many sellers. The stock price is just the sum of the open interest, and you don't have to worry about the stock price at any point in time.\n",

      "Does the bid price of a stock change depending on which brokerage I am using?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  It depends on the broker you use. I've used two different brokers, both in the US.  If you use Vanguard, the prices of stocks are calculated based on the market cap of each fund.  For example, if you buy VTI, the market cap is $120 billion, but if you buy VXUS, it is only $500 billion.  You don't pay a single penny for a broker.  It is worth noting that Vanguard has a terrible online system.  They don't tell you the price of stocks, they tell you the price you can get for that stock.  You have to enter the price manually, and then manually enter the price you want to buy.  This is not good practice.  In the US, the average price you see for an individual fund is the market cap, which is $13.87.  You are not getting the exact price that you pay for that fund.  You can get the exact price, but the broker isn't getting the exact price.  Vanguard's prices are based on the market caps of all the funds they have\n",

      "How do I refinance a car loan into someone else's name so it can be their car?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  I would say the first step is to get a loan from a bank, preferably a credit union, that offers a \"pay cash\" car financing program.  If you are going to pay cash, you will be subject to the usual risks associated with paying cash for a car, such as theft, etc.  The best way to avoid these risks is to pay cash for the car, then put the money you would spend on the car into a savings account.   The reason I'd do this is that I don't know if you'll have a car, or even if you'll ever have a car, by the time you get a loan.  Having a car is just one of the costs you'll pay for your life.  If you get a loan for the car, you'll still have to pay for that car.  You'll still have the cost of gas, maintenance, insurance, taxes, etc.  If you don't get a loan, the cost of the loan is less.  If you have to pay more than you have to for a loan, you will still have a car.  If you can\n",

      "If I put a large down payment (over 50%) towards a car loan, can I reduce my interest rate and is it smart to even put that much down?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  The answer to your question depends on your credit rating and other factors.  If you have a history of paying your bills on time and are a responsible borrower, then you may be able to lower your interest rate and possibly lower your monthly payment.  You can do this by paying extra on your debt, by paying extra to your car dealer, or by paying down a car loan that you have.  However, if you have no history of making regular payments, your credit rating may not be strong enough to make it worthwhile.  That being said, I would pay extra on your car loan.  If you put your extra money down, it will take a long time to reduce your debt.  It may take 20 years or more to pay off the car loan.  That is just an example.\n",

I don't have a single card for a month, so I can't say if I should or shouldn't do it.  I would be surprised if they wouldn't change the policy, especially since they know I won't use the card.\n",

      " Answer:  You need to talk to her. I have heard horror stories about the people who have their children as part of a family arrangement, and their children get a bad start. The best thing you can do is talk to her about it. Talk to her about how she is treating your children and what you can do to help. Tell her that she needs to get her priorities straightened out before you are involved in her finances.  It sounds like you have some pretty good ideas for helping her, but don't let her continue to treat you like a criminal or victim. If she is really a criminal, you will get into some legal trouble. If you are a victim, the government will come after you. I am sure the people in your area have good advice for you.  My son had a mother who used to live with him and we were in court over her visitations with her children. She was found guilty of child neglect. I think this is pretty harsh but I was in court at the time. We went through a lot of counseling to help her, and we made our peace. Now she lives in a different state but she is still in the system.

If the market does not have money to invest in a company, the company will have to raise more capital to invest.  If the company is going to be acquired by another company, the acquirer will always have more cash on hand to invest in the new company.

Selling your shares of company will have to be done in a tax deferred account. You will pay taxes on the money you receive for selling your shares of the stock, and if you hold for a year or more you will have to pay taxes on that money. If you sell your shares at the right time, you will have to make a profit on your shares of the new company.  If you sell your stock at the right time and sell the shares of the company you can still get a profit, and you can keep the money for yourself, but you can sell the stock at the right price.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  In the US, you have two options. You can either use the bank's mortgage calculator to estimate the amount of money you need to save. You can use a calculator from the bank (e.g. my bank's mortage calculator) to get a ballpark estimate of the amount of money that you need to save for retirement. This is called an expected monthly payment (EMP) and it's the amount of money in your retirement that you will need to save each month. I personally find the 15-20% rule to be a reasonable ballpark. You will want to make sure that you are comfortable with the EMP.  If you are concerned about how long you have to retire, I would suggest saving a little extra money in a money market account. That way, you will still have a little cash flow in the bank if you are forced to retire, but you will have more cash flow in retirement.\n",

The cost of the rent will be based on the cost of the property and the tenant will have to pay the landlord's part of the lease.  I would not pay a monthly rent to someone else. I would pay a monthly lease for my property. The lease you are looking at is usually one year.  If you are in the US, you can sign a yearly lease with no monthly payments.  I think it is very reasonable to sign a monthly leasing arrangement with no payments.  If you think you will be there for the long term and can afford to pay the lease, go for it.\n",

Options trading on margin carry a margin penalty, so you are effectively paying interest on the money you are borrowing.  If you do sell, the IRS expects that you are paying the margin.

I believe that if you have been in the stock for 1 year or more and you are eligible, you can sell your shares of stock.

      "15 year mortgage vs 30 year paid off in 15\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  I am not sure about the mortgage calculator you are looking for. The one I used was for my mortgage.  So I will make a guess at your question. It seems that you are looking at paying 15% on a 15 year mortage vs 3% on a 30 year mortgage. So you are getting 4% return on a 100000 dollar investment. It is safe to say that this is not a great return on your money. But the question is what are the returns that you are getting.  Your mortgage calculators say that you can get 3% on the 15 year, 3% on 30 year. The difference is not that great. You can do much better. I am not sure why you are thinking that you are going to get 3% or 1% on a 4% return. You are probably not going to do much better. If you are looking at 4% on the 30 year you are not likely to do much better than 1% on the 4% return you are getting.\n",

This should be an emergency fund, so that you can weather a hard situation.  You should also be saving for retirement.  I'd suggest putting away at least 10% of your paycheck for retirement.\n",

      "When is it better to rent and when is better buy in a certain property market?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  There are two major problems I can see with buying a property that is in an up-market area and renting it out: You will need a lot of money and you need to spend it somewhere. The downside is that you have to make sure the place is always clean and tidy. There is a good chance that you will need to change the roof or replace the plaster or paint, so you need to spend money on that. I don't think it makes much of a difference in the long run. You will also need to find a tenant. If it is a short term tenant then you can rent it out for a while. You will have to pay rent, and you have to find someone to move in. If you are a good tenant you can stay for a while. If you are not a good tenant then you will have to look for a tenant who will be happy to stay. I would say the downside is that there is a chance that you might not find a tenant, and you will have to change the rent. The problem with this is that if the property does not sell in a year you might not have a job to find someone. This is the risk\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  It depends on how much you are prepared to pay.  If you can pay for it up front, and you want to make a purchase that is safe, you should not be purchasing it.  If you pay for it in full in advance, you will have a good idea of what the value is of your car, and you will have a better idea of what you can afford to pay. If you are going to make a big purchase and don't want to have to make a payment for it, then I suggest you go to the bank and put your deposit into a CD.  You will have some money to use as collateral if the car loses value, but the interest you pay is still tax deductible. If you are planning on using a loan, then that's a different story.\n",

The 401K plan has an option to put $100K in stocks, bonds, or other investments with the option to convert the stock into a bond.  If the 40 year treasury is worth $1000 at $50, and you don't have to pay taxes on $50K, it makes sense to take the money out of the 40 yr IRA and put it into stocks, bills, or other investment that will make more than $50K over the 40 years.  This is a \"risk\" as opposed to an \"average\".  You also have to keep track of what your options are and choose wisely.  Some people do this and others don't.  The other reason for doing this is if you are in a high tax bracket.  You can't put $50K in the 4\n",

They don't care if you pay your bill in full or have a balance. They will never even know you have a credit card. 3) It will be reported on your credit report as you have no history of credit card debt.

When you sell your synthetic option position, you are taking on risk that the synthetic option will lose value, and the other person might sell. You should never sell an option unless you have a real reason to do so.  You have already decided to sell the option, and now you're selling.  Selling an option that you already have is selling the right product to the wrong customer.  Selling a synthetic option is not a product, it is an option.\n",

It doesn't mean that you have to do so, you don't have to pay anything if you're shorting the stock.   Short selling is simply shorting a security, whether or not you actually do the short sell.  If you want to short a stock, you will need to pay the current market ask price.  If you don't think you will be able to get a good ask price, you might want to wait until it is clear to the market that you are going to try to get out of the position.  Or you might want to try a different strategy.  The point is that you are not shorting a security.\n",

You should be aware that the IRS will charge you a fee for the privilege of doing so, and that the IRS is not going to care about it.  This is why you need a separate account.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I think what you are looking for is called \"Fundamental Analysis\". Basically you are looking for a strategy to buy or sell based on fundamental analysis. A stock will always be bought or sold if: A stock is currently undervalued, or the company is currently trading at a discount to the fair market value. If the stock is overvalued or trading at a premium to the fair market price, then you will have to wait for it to go back up.  A stock will always stay undervalued if: A stock will always trade at a discount, or if the stock is undervalued and trading at a price below the market's expectation. A stock will be bought or sold at a discount when the stock is trading at a fair market price. The price at which the company is trading at will affect the price of the stock. A stock will not trade at the discount price if the company's earnings expectations are out of the ballpark, or if the company is going to be hit by some event that will drive the price down. So the company may sell or buy at a discount in the past. A stock may be overvalued or\n",

It even has a separate account for my husband's payroll account.  I also have it set up for my wife's salary, so I can set it up for her to receive a salary check every paycheck.

You will not be able to invest in a company if it is not registered with a Registrar of Companies in your State. You will not be sure that the company has actually paid taxes in the past, as that is very important. You will not get to see the tax records that have been filed, so you will not know if you were paid or not. You will not know the name of the people that have been managing the company and you will not know whether they are honest people or not.

The problem is that it's a way for you to put money into your 401(k) without having to put money into the retirement account. You can't have one in both.  It would be a bad thing to have one in both, because you would be putting money into both accounts.  If you want to keep the money separate you can put it in a CD, and it would be a bad idea to have both CD's in a Roth IRA because you have to make sure that you can get it out of one.\n",

ETFs are just another way to invest in index funds. Index funds are a way to invest in a variety of index funds.  If you're willing to invest in the whole world (or a single country or a single stock), the whole world would be an index fund.  The ETFs would be just the part of that index fund.\n",

You don't need to worry about depreciating assets, which are just plain depreciating and don't need depreciating at all. You're just selling stuff you own.

If you have an opinion, you can make a profit from this investment. Second, I think there's a difference between \"you can lose money on a property\" and \"you can lose a lot on a property\".  A big difference is that with a property you're not paying rent. If you have a property, you pay rent, but you don't pay to live in. You can also be a landlord and not get any rent. The other difference is that if you own a property you get tax deductions. I'm a bit surprised at your assertion that this doesn't apply to a single property. If you own multiple properties you can do it.\n",

      " Answer:  First of all you need to understand that real estate is a business, and real estate can be very lucrative, and very risky. It is not as simple as buying a house and renting it out.  The biggest reason to buy a house is to be close to your family, and to avoid the commute to your job. But it can be a very bad business, and it can be a bad investment.  It will be difficult to sell if you need to sell, and it can get into a lot of trouble if you get in a legal dispute.  You can also lose money on it. The biggest problem is that the value of the property is not tied to the rental market.  If you are renting your house you can't expect it to increase in value.  You can expect it to decrease in value, but it will be temporary, and will not be an indicator of the value of the economy.\n",

      "Does the stock market create any sort of value?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  You are probably missing a lot of factors. Firstly, the most obvious thing is that the price of the stock depends on the performance of the company.  If you buy at $5, the stock price is likely to be a lot higher than it is now. If you buy at 100, it's unlikely that you'll get a 100% return on that transaction.  But if you buy at 500 and it goes up to 200, you might have a 10% return.  The stock price of a company will go up and down depending on what people think it will do, and the company's prospects, and how good they think it is.  The only real value that the stock can have is in the form of dividends and other cash flows, so if a company goes bankrupt or is bought out, you might get that too. So it's not clear whether buying stock at a high price will actually be a good idea.  I think there's more to it than that, and there are lots of other factors to take into account.\n",

      "How much of my home loan is coming from a bank, how much it goes back? \n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  There are a few different ways that you are paying for the loan, the banks can put it on your credit report, but it can only be done by your bank, not the other way around. For example, if you go to a different bank to get the loan, they will check your credit report to see if they can do the loan for you, or even if they don't, they will let you pay the loan off with no problems. They may also do the loan if they want to sell the house, or to invest it in some other way, but they have to do that first. If you go to a bank, the bank will give you the loan amount, and the bank will put it on your record, and the bank can tell you whether they can make the loan. If they can't, they may or may not be able to sell the house. You will be asked a few questions. You will be able to answer that question if you have a credit report with them. You will be required to provide proof of that. If they can tell you whether you have the money to make the loan, you can tell them that and you will probably get a lower interest rate.

      "Is Real Estate ever a BAD investment? If so, when?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  In general, I would not make an investment decision based on the price of real estate. Investments in real estate generally come from a variety of sources. For example, it is possible to buy real estate that is in the process of being torn down or demolished. This is a common scenario in which real estate investors can buy a property for an amount of money higher than the market price of the real estate. In the United States, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has the Fannie Mae-Freddie Mac mortgage program which allows a Fannie Maa-Freddie Mae to loan money to banks or investment funds that can provide financing to Fannie Maes and Freddie Mac mortgages. It is possible to borrow money from the FHFA, especially if you are able to find a bank or investment fund that is willing to take on more risk. In many cases, Fannie Maem and Freddie Mac will take on more risk to invest in real estate than other types of investments, such as stocks or bonds. The risks are usually higher, though, and the returns may be lower.\n",

I'm sure you can do it, too.  Just start small.  Work through the categories that you know you're spending money on.  If you find yourself spending more money on coffee than you used to, just say \"I don't want to spend more on coffee\".  If you find that your coffee consumption is too high, just start by decreasing it.  Work through it slowly, and make sure you're aware of it.

I just got an exchange rate quote and it is the best I've ever gotten.  It is pretty low (1.4%), but it's pretty good.  I also found the US exchange rate is pretty high (6.3%), but I've found that it is better to do currency exchange in India.  There is a large amount of international transfer fees.  You should check with your broker, they might charge you for the transfer.  Also, some brokers charge you for currency conversion while others don't.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  It's worth noting that you are making a decision to invest in the stock market.  This decision is not a bad one.  But it is not a very good one.  You are looking at a 401k with a very high expense ratio.  It's a bad idea.  In fact, you're making a bad decision.  You should take your money elsewhere, even if you're making this decision to invest in a 40 year old stock.  The question of whether you should invest your money in stocks or in bonds is a tough one.  If you are looking to put your money in a stock, you should just take the stocks.  You may want to do that if you have the time.  If you don't want to put your money into a stock, you're better off investing in your 401K.\n",

      " Answer:  The only advice I would give you is that your tax adviser is not necessarily best suited to your needs.  For example, I am a tax professional, and I know what to do with my IRA, but the advice given by my tax adviser is usually that it is too late to change my investments, because I am already paying taxes.  I have asked the same question, and received the same answer, and I have chosen a different adviser.  So the question remains, \"what should I do?\" I don't know.  But I'm going to do what I did, and pick the adviser who is the best fit for me.  And I'm going with the guy who I did my research with, and who has always answered my questions with the right information.  I hope this helps. Good luck.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  This is a tough one to answer.  If you were talking about a portfolio, say a 401k, that is just money in a 403b.  You are not investing for the long term, you are investing for the short term.  This is where you are trying to maximize the return on your money.  If you had put the money in the portfolio, then you would be trying to maximize your return.  If you have invested for 25 years in a portfolio that you bought 10 years ago, you have to pay interest on that money.  You might have to pay it in a 10 year CD to a 40 year CD.  If you buy a portfolio with 25 years to go, you will have to pay 20% in interest.  That's 25% of the 25 year CD.  Your 10 year rate of return would be about 10%.  The 10 year portfolio would have about 20% interest on it.  So if you buy a 20 year CD at 5%, you would pay\n",

The question is what are you trying to do?  Is it a side business you are doing on the side, or a full time job? If you are doing side business, you are not guaranteed to make 100,000 dollars.  If you are doing it full time, you can expect to make around 3-4 million dollars.  If it's just an extra job, you can expect that you will be making around 200,0\n",

I'm not sure what that says about the student loan rules, but the IRS has issued a rule that you must contribute to a 529 plan if you are a 60 or older, you are a college participant, and the 60 years or older.  That's another issue. If you're just a student, you're just making the loan payment.  I'd say you should just keep the loan and put it into a tax-advantaged account.

It was just as bad as I expected, and the company's claim to fame is that they're a \"title company\" which means they can look up the ownership of a property without needing a land survey. But this wasn't true. I called the company and asked for a \"title search\", and I found that they only looked up the ownership of the land, not the actual land itself. The claim to fame for this company is that they are the only title company which can do a title search for you. This is probably the reason I never used them, but I have no idea if it is true.\n",

      " Answer:  This is a common scam. They will use your bank account to withdraw the money from your bank account.  They will send a wire transfer to you from your bank account, and you will need to pay them in full. If you can't pay, you'll lose it.  In this case, I would contact your bank.  You will be asked to verify your identity.  If they refuse, then I would contact the bank directly.  This way you can get them to take their money.  If they still refuse, I would contact the state Attorney General, or the Federal Trade Commission.  I'd make sure you do it in writing.  They can be very convincing.  Just don't do it.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I'd approach this with a few things: If the buyer is willing to pay you a premium for being the sole seller of the property then you'd have to agree to that premium. I'd take the premium as a \"reward\" to the seller, and then just pay off the rest of the mortgage on the other property. That way you don't get hit with a 3% closing fee, and you can pay off the mortgage faster.  If the seller wants to split you into 2 properties, then you should probably just put your money down for the one you want. That way you can get 2 properties in the end. If you get into the house, then you'll have the choice to sell the first house and keep the other 2.\n",

Brokerage accounts are just that - brokerage accounts. A bank account has a fixed value, but is a little more liquid, and thus less risk. A brokerage account, on the other hand, has some risk, and is not necessarily less liquid, because you are more likely to have a bad day with a stock or mutual fund than a bank account. A stock is not the same as an account.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  You are doing a lot of good things.  You are trying to save money, but not in a way that will hurt you or your family.  You are saving $25,000/yr, and you are not living in a retirement account.  You are also paying for college, so you will need to pay for that in a couple of years. You are not paying interest on the loan.  So, it is not that you are borrowing money for a car.  It is that you are paying money for a loan.  The car is a big deal.  It can change your life.  It can take a lot of pressure off your shoulders.  But, you have a car.  You don't have a house.  And you are living on a fixed income.  That makes it more important for you to pay off the loan.  This is a hard decision to make.  But you will have a job soon.  If you get a job you will be able to pay off the car.  The car will probably be worth more.  You will have a better credit score.  That can really make a difference.  You will also have\n",

The dividend distribution is determined by the company's financial position and its dividend distribution, which are the same thing.

So for example, I have an ISA that pays around 1.7% for all of its funds, but is doing something like 1.3% for this fund. This is because of the way ISA's work. If you are buying ISA's that pay a lower rate than the market, you can still be well ahead of the market, but you'll still be losing money because of fees.  So in this case, you could do a lot worse.\n",

If you are looking for a car that is still new but you are trying to keep the value of the car for 10-15 years, you could try to find a car that is under 3 years old.

I'd get a loan to pay for school (at least for a semester), and save up some extra money. A car loan is a huge commitment and it's worth researching before taking the leap. I personally would do a car loan for three years or so. If you pay it off in 3 years, that's a pretty decent chunk of money. The biggest factor to consider is that you can't get a car loan and still be able to make a reasonable monthly payment. If you want to pay it off in two years, that'll take some research.\n",

      " Answer:  Your question is very confusing because you are not thinking of a car as a long term investment. You want to buy a car that you can drive everyday for 5 years. A new car is an investment and a long term one at that.  You will not be able to buy one that is only a few years old. This is why you need to think about your situation and your financial situation before buying. If you have the money to buy a new car then you should. If you don't have the money then you are still going to need to pay for the car. You might also be able to find the money on your pay check to invest in a stock. But if you don't invest in a stock then you will end up paying for the car with the money that you have saved up. You are looking to save up for the car. This is a very big decision. If you are not going to be able to buy a new or used car in the next 5 years then you need to save up. If you are willing to buy a new vehicle everyday for the next 5 year then you should buy a car.\n",

      " Answer:  I agree with most of the answers.  The best thing I can do is not buy a home until I have my mortgage.  If you can pay the mortgage off quickly, it is a better investment than the money you would spend in closing costs.  If you don't pay the mortgages quickly, the mortgage will be paid off very early.  In many cases, it is possible to avoid paying the mortgage until you have enough money to pay off the loan early.  In this case, you might want to consider selling your current home, if you can do so.  Selling is a very good thing to do.\n",

      " Answer:  You could use the same method of calculation as you have, and then do a bit of googling, as you would any investment. It seems like you are looking at it from a very different perspective than the average investor. The other factor that you would want to consider is whether you are looking for a long term or a short term investment.  If you are looking for long term investment, then it seems like the risk is very small. If you are looking at a short term investing, then the risk is much higher.  For your question, if I were to buy a $20 stock and sell it within the next few days, would I be able to expect a 15% gain or a 25% gain? You can expect a 25%, but you cannot predict if the stock will go down 25% in a day or a year.  In this case, if you sell your stock, you might still make a profit, but not the $20 that you thought you were going to make.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  If you're talking about a single dollar amount, then that is the right answer.  For a dollar amount over 1 cent you're going to see that the result is less than one percent.  In other words, if I had to guess, I would guess that the result would be about 1-1/10% or so.  In reality, that would be a little more like 1-11/10%, so it would be 0.011%.  I don't know why this is the case, but I'm willing to guess that it is something like that.\n",

You can get 15-year loans for 3.12%, but you'll pay about $10,000 for 30 years.  That's a little high for me.  I'd rather pay $1,000 every month for the next 20 years.

      " Answer:  This is an excellent question and a great point of view.   This is also a good answer to the question of why would a bank or other financial institution be interested in making money.  I would say it is an answer that is generally unreasonable to the banking industry, at least in the United States.  There are a lot of factors that could make a bank think they are making a profit.  Some of the factors that could make the bank think they are actually making a profit are the banks ability to generate interest on a loan, the cost of the loan, the ability of the bank to get credit from a bank, the cost of getting credit from a bank in other countries, the ability of a bank to get credit in other countries, and other factors.  If you think about it, you can make money when a bank goes broke.  You can make money when you have a lot of credit and can use that to get credit in another country.  You can also make money when you get a new credit card or debit card.  You could make money when you are a student or a person who is just starting out and you can use that money to get a loan.

      " Answer:  If the interest rate on your loan is 0% for 36 months, and your interest rate on a fixed-rate loan is 2.75% you will still pay 0.005% interest over the 36 months of interest on the $27500 loan.

      "What implications does having the highest household debt to disposable income ratio have on Australia?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  The first question is interesting, I would argue that the first two are also of a much bigger import to a nation. In the UK we have had some very high household debt to GDP ratios and those of course made the poor more vulnerable to the impacts of unemployment and other problems. This was compounded by the fact that a high household debt was associated with a high household debtor: this is of course an important factor to consider if the poor were to have difficulty finding employment, particularly with limited resources. As I said, the second question is interesting, if Australia's current ratio is 1.6% of GDP, then we have to consider the fact that we have one of the highest debt to Gdp ratios in the world. That is a big part of why we are in this position. If we had a debt to disposables ratio of 0.00% we would be in a position where we are able to continue to have very high debt to disposals and not have a serious issue. That is a good thing for a nation that has so much debt to disposal ratio. This is also of course very important as debt\n",

A stock with a 100 days MA will go down by 10% and up by 10%.  This is called a 200% gain. A stock with a moving average of 200-100 days has a 20% gain, a stock with a moving MA of 20-10 days has a -20% gain.  If you look at the 20-200 days moving MA you can see that it has lost 12% in value.\n",

In general, the risk of the house not selling is high enough that you may be better off in some other form of investment.  If you are thinking about buying a house, I suggest you get a few quotes from local realtors and start comparing what you can get.  If you have a very high-priced home, you may be better served by getting a mortgage that you can refinance.  If you can't refinance, you may want to sell and put your money into other investments.\n",

For the share price to be higher than the earning per share, that would be to the company's shareholders and would also imply a very large market capitalization. If that were the case, the company would be making huge profits. It would be very risky to assume that the earnings per company is always the same as the share price.

      " Answer:  I don't think I'm going to be able to contribute to your retirement fund because I'm in the process of selling my house and the last 10 years of it has been a mess. I'm thinking about a Roth IRA, but I'm also in the process of buying a house. So I'm not sure if it's worth it. If you can contribute to a Roth IRA you can contribute to the Roth IRA and earn some tax deduction.  There is also a way to contribute to your IRA without taxes. You can contribute to a Traditional IRA and then put it into a Roth IRA.  This is called a Traditional Ira contribution.\n",

      "If the co-signer on my car loan dies, can the family take the car from me like they're threatening to?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  My understanding is that the bank won't care, and the law will be trumped up by a judge who is going to give you a new loan with a new co-signer.  If you can't afford to pay the new loan in full by the due date, the bank is going to try to collect.  They can't do it if they can't even get a loan from you.  In that case, they're probably going to sue you.  The court may order them to return the car to you.  In which case, you're going to have to pay the legal fees.\n",

      "Should I really pay off my entire credit card balance each month or should I maintain some balance?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  This is a good question to ask.  My guess is that the average credit card user is a person who has no significant debt.  It seems to me that if you were to pay off the card balance each month you'd be paying off the card balance every 12 months or so.  The card company gets a percentage of every payment that they receive.  So you might want to pay the card balance off in one month if you can.   The problem is that the card company gets the credit card company's money.  This is called fees and is the reason that you get charged a percentage of every purchase you make.  So if you pay off the card bill every 12, the bank gets 12% of every purchase they make.  The company gets 12.2% of every credit card transaction.  You're making them money.  That's not the only way the bank can make money.  If they don't get their money back you might be able to sue them.  I suppose they could have a lawsuit going on.\n",

There is no \"right\" answer to this question, but my own experience is that it depends a lot on your personal situation.  If you want to invest in stocks, you should be saving money first.  The Japanese stock market has been booming recently, and you may want to keep that in mind.  You should also consider your other investments, such as bonds and savings.  You should consider whether your savings is enough to cover your living expenses if you are unemployed.  It's worthwhile to save for this if you're going to need the money in the future.

      "What prevents interest rates from rising?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  If interest rates rise, the amount of credit available for loans will go down. This makes it more difficult to borrow money. As interest rates rise, lenders will want to raise the minimum amount of credit available. So the lender will increase the amount of credit you can get. The amount of credit available will decrease. So the lenders will want lower minimum credit amounts. As the minimum amount of available credit increases, the amount of available credit decreases. The rate at which this is done will also decrease, so there's no real risk of the interest rates going up. If there is any risk of an increase in the interest rates, there will be an increase in the rate of inflation. This means that your money will be worth less in a year. So you might have to pay more to borrow money than you are currently paying. This will increase the cost of borrowing money, which will decrease your monthly expenses. So if you are paying more to borrow money, you're not getting a better rate of return on your money.\n",

I'm guessing that would be 100% in equity markets.  The S&P 400 is the market cap of 400 publicly traded stocks that represent all the publicly traded shares of a large publicly traded company. The S&P5 is the market cap for the 500 publicly-traded companies of that company. So the S&P is a total market index, and the S&P index represents the total market of the stocks of the companies in that index.

      " Answer:  If the stock is down and the price has gone up, I would take a look at the company. They may have a stock splits and may be selling their assets to buy the new shares. That may not be a good idea though. I've seen stock splits happen at companies like Apple, but I've also seen companies like Berkshire Hathaway, GE, Microsoft, Cisco, and many other companies that have splits.  If the stock price is still at the high point of the uptrend I would just hold the stock until it goes down and then re-invest the money. I've had this happen many times when the stock is going up. The problem is if the stock splits the price will still go down but at the high point the stock will be much higher.  You could also just do some research and make a few guesses based on the price and your guesses the company could be down and the stock could be going up.  I wouldn't do it though.

For example, if you bought a covered call option that was 100 contracts, you would have to pay tax on $1000 of the gain.  The IRS would then issue you with a 10% penalty and/or a 100% increase in your tax liability.  If you exercised in less than 60 days, you could not choose the tax treatment.  If you were an owner of a covered call option in the 10 year period you are in the 15 year period, you will have to choose the tax treatment as described in the first link.   If you exercised at the end of the 15-year period you would still pay tax on the loss, as described in the link.   For the IRS, you would need to choose a different tax treatment.

      " Answer:  I was able to get my money out of the school loan at 38 years old.  In my case, I started the process at 16 years old.  It was not as simple as you are suggesting.   I am not sure if this is the case for everyone, but I was able to refinance my loans at 34 years old.  I think this is because they were at 30% interest.   The student loan company was able to help me out and refinance my loan for the lower amount.  I was able to lower the amount on the loan by $400.  The company was able to refund the money, but it was not all my fault.  I am not sure what caused my company to refund my money.  I will have to ask my company to explain the refunds.\n",

      "How much more than my mortgage should I charge for rent?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  There are a number of reasons why you might consider renting rather than owning. If you have a job and a house, that's a no-brainer.  I don't have any real estate experience but I do know that owning a house can be a good investment if you have the cash and can handle the maintenance. If you don't have a job and you don't want to work from home, you can rent and still make some money. You will be able to get a better rent than you would pay if you are paying into the homeowner's association and you'll have a better idea of how much it costs to run the house. You can get a better return from owning a house. If you are thinking about buying your next home, I would suggest a 30 year fixed rate mortgage. That way you won't pay a penny more on interest, but you'll still be paying into the mortgage. You will save a lot of money by owning a house rather than renting.\n",

The most common is the options on the SPX.  A call option is a call option on SPX.  You can also see how the options on the S&P500 can have arbitrage opportunity, though I don't think you would see an arbitrage here. The most recent example was the option on SPY.  A put option is a put option on SPX, and you can see how this could have arbitrage potential.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  As a former buyer of REIT's, I will give my opinion on why they are not a good deal for the average investor. The biggest reason is the fact that they have the advantage of being able to use your money in the same manner as you would with any other asset class.  If I were to buy the same asset class, and sell the asset at a profit, would I buy another asset class at the same rate, or do I sell it at a loss? The real question is what is the real return on the asset class, and what are the costs.  Buying REIT'S is a good idea for those who are willing to accept the risk.  But I doubt that the investor is willing to accept the loss.\n",

      " Answer:  There are a number of issues that can arise in a scenario like this.   Your question is really about \"Do I have the money, the ability to get a loan for my current home and the house I want to buy?\"  My answer is \"No.\"  There are some great answers already on this site, but I will try to provide my personal take on the subject.   The first issue you face is that you have a lot of money, and a lot of debt.  In a house with a mortgage, you have to deal with the debt on top of the money you have.  You are in a situation where you are already having a hard time with your current situation.  The mortgage on the new house will take a big chunk out of your income.  It will also add another $300k+ to the cost of the new house, and then there will be a big increase in the tax bill, as you will need to pay off the new mortgage.  This is going to make you pay more money on average.  If you were to make your payment and never touch it, then you are just throwing money away.  If you start making a lot\n",

The reason for that is that in the case of 30 years a home will only be worth $20K if you can sell it for 10% below market. This is why it is so important to get a mortgage with no closing costs.  There are some other costs that come into play if you buy a 30-year loan with closing costs, but for the most part it is all about the closing costs.\n",

It seems I got a good job and started working at a new company.  I asked the lender to decrease my credit limit by 20%, but they said they'll only lower the limit by 10%.  I called them, and they said I'd be fine. But then I got a call from my current lender.  They said I'll lose my job if I don't pay.  So I had a new lender, and the credit card company was not happy that I'd not paid off the debt.  I've been in this situation several times.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  The fact that you are in a house, not a mutual fund, is a very good reason to invest your money in something else.  Your mortgage is the primary reason to invest in the market, and you should not let the mortgage be the only reason you invest.  If you are really looking for an investment, you can put money in a savings account at your local bank, and use that to buy something else.  If you have a long-term investment, such as a stock fund, it is not necessary to have a mortgage.  You can buy a stock fund with your mortgage funds, and pay off the mortgage in the long term.  That should help you stay out of the mortgage. If you want to make the mortgage less of a hassle, you can sell the house.  You should not let a mortgage be a hassle.\n",

If you're just starting out it's possible that the fund will have no money to give you, but the company is giving you what's called \"units\" to begin with, so you'll be able to get the same type of return.  If they're just giving you the money that they think you need, it's likely that they're just doing it for the sake of doing it, and they'll just make you pay a fee.\n",

I would just get a 10 year fixed, but I wouldn't be surprised if the rates go up in 10 years.  If your emergency fund is 5 years, you are ahead of the game, but there is nothing stopping you from saving it up, and buying now.   You will want to do something to save up for a house, but this is not one of them.  If you want to buy a house now, I would wait and get a fixed rate loan, if you don't need to buy in 10 or 15 years.\n",

When you buy groceries, try to look for items that are on sale and are less expensive, or ones that you know you don't like. I also try to buy things that I will use over and over again. For example, I have an iPhone that I don't use that I would like to get rid of. But I don't want to spend more than I have to on it. If you have an iPhone, you can look at buying a $50 phone. If you can live without a $50 smartphone, you can probably buy something that is worth that much.  It's just a matter of finding what you need.\n",

      " Answer:  In the United States, the price of gold is subject to inflation, and you're basically just trying to sell your gold for a lower price. The Federal Reserve sets the gold rate in order to prevent the inflation from being inflated. So if a gold price of $100/oz is $10/oz, and you buy 1 oz of gold for $100, that $100 of gold is $10. If it was worth $100 and you buy 2 oz of gold at $100 for $20, you'll pay $20. So in the long run, gold is worth less than what you paid for it.\n",

      "Do budgeting % breakdowns apply globally?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  There are 2 things I have noticed. First of all, this is not the same as the percentage breakdowns you are hearing in the articles. There are 10% and 15% breakdowns.  So, if you're a single person and your budget is $1000/yr you can have a 25% breakdown of your budget. This is only if you have a 10% breakdown.  Secondly, I think that it is a good idea to have 2 or more different breakdowns for your budget so that you can make sense of the numbers.  For example, if you have 10% budget breakdowns, then 15% budget breakdown. This is better than having one big breakdown that is hard to understand.  You can also use this as a budget for your own home.  It is nice that you're thinking about this ahead of time.\n",

You have time to save up money for the next big purchase.  You have plenty of money to invest and not need a high interest loan.  Your goal shouldn't be to put a ton of money away in a 401k, but rather invest in an IRA.  You should invest the money you'd get from your IRA, but you should be diversified.  A lot of people recommend the 80/20 rule.  In my opinion, 20% is probably too high.  You can afford to put more money in your IRA, and still save.\n",

When you do a rollover, it is recorded at the new date, i.e. the date you put in your new 401K account.  If you do it at year end, then it would have to be the end of the last year, but this would not make much sense because the rollover would not be done until the year after.

      "What does inflation mean to me?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  Inflation is simply an estimate of what the money supply will look like.  If you are buying a $1000 car for $10,000,001 today, that means inflation will go up to $10,500,019 in 2017, but the car will have increased in value.  If you bought it $10,200 today, it will cost you $11,000 in 20 years to replace it, but the car's value will increase from $10,400 to $12,200. If you want to calculate inflation yourself, it is a little trickier.  In a recent article for CQMG, they talk about the inflation of the US dollar.  In short, inflation is based on what the money supply looks like.  If inflation is higher than the money supply, you are being over-inflated.  In your case, it looks like the inflation is more of an indicator of what the money supplies might look like, which is good.  In the end, I don't think it\n",

If you have to go to a remote, unknown place, the firearms and ammo you carry are probably your most valuable asset.  If you're not in an area where you can easily go to the nearest stores, you can use the ammo and guns to protect yourself from the enemy, and if you have to go on foot, you can take advantage of the firearms to help you find the enemy, as well as your own defenses.  There are a lot of different kinds of ammo you can use, and a lot of different types of weapons you can use, but the primary thing that you'll want to look at are the types of ammo you carry, and the type of weapons you can take advantage.

If you have a long term investment, such as an individual stock, or an ETF, a stop loss is usually used to ensure you never sell. A stop loss will only be triggered if you're selling a stock.

      " Answer:  I'm not a lawyer or a tax adviser, so please take my answer as an educated guess and not a legal/tax advice. In the US, the money is held in a \"wire transfer account\" which is a kind of bank account where the funds are held until the money is actually delivered.  This can be anywhere from 3 business days to 15 business days.   It is possible that you can use a wire transfer to transfer funds from a savings account into a wire transfer account.  In theory, a wire transfer will take longer because the transfer must be made from the original bank account, but in practice, it is common for people to transfer money from savings accounts to wire transfer accounts.\n",

You can choose to re-establish AMT or to not re-estabilize AMT, but you'll still be paying the same taxes regardless.  You can always elect to do both, but you're unlikely to be in a situation where the IRS has any reason to believe you have earned $20K in the current year.  I've been in this situation a couple times, and the IRS will be happy to send me a letter saying \"no, you're still eligible to pay the $20K due this year.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  There is a way to get a good price, if you have a good credit score, but I would not expect you to get it from a company. If you are very poorly off financially, and have a good credit record, there is a way you could get it for free. If you have bad credit record, you are probably going to have to pay a higher premium. If you are not poorly off finanically, and have a credit record, you can get a better rate. You can call a number of companies, and ask them if they would give you a quote. I would think that a good number of companies will give you a quote, because they know the people that are going to pay the most money are people that are poor off financially.  The reason is that a company that does a lot of business for them is a good company, and that will get the most money out of them, as a good number of people will want to buy insurance from a good company. If a company gets it right, they can get a lot more money out of you than they get out of their customers.\n",

It is not uncommon for a bank to give a 0% interest rate if you take out a 0% loan.  You could pay off the debts, but if you don't pay off the debit card or car loan you will have to get an interest rate on a loan. If you don't mind the 0% rate you can always get a car loan for $30,000.  If you don'y mind the interest rate you can try a 0% rate for the next 12 months.  If you are willing to take the risk, I'd do that.\n",

They said \"I'm not going to lower the rate. We have 18 years left on the loan.

      "value of guaranteeing a business loan\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  It's not that simple. If you're going to loan money to a business, you want a fixed interest rate.  A business can't make money by not paying it back.  In that case, you have to decide what you will give up in order to get that fixed rate.  You're not going to be able to do it. You can probably get a loan from a bank at a higher rate.  They'll charge you a percentage of the interest rate, though. If you've already spent $25k and the loan will cost you $5k, then that's $15k in risk.  If you have a $10k loan, you're still going to lose money.\n",

I think you are asking about the lack of opportunities for people in countries that have relatively stable economies.   In countries like the US, we have a great example of this.  There are very few people in high-incomes countries, even with the most developed countries.  Even in high-incomer countries like the UK, most people in high-wage countries are not high-incomers.   If the US had a similar situation in a developing country, it would be much better.  The US has a lot of high-income people and people that are working very hard and have a lot of potential.  But in countries like the UK and India, there is not enough opportunity for people to work in a high-income country.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  Borrowing from one bank to buy a stock can be done, but that is more risky.  It can be done for a variety of reasons, including a company going bankrupt.  If your short selling company is liquidated you may be forced to close out your account.  You might also be required to pay for all of the closing costs. If you sell short your investment, your shares are then held by the bank you borrowed from.  That is the bank that owns the stock and you are the only person that owns it.  So, you can be held responsible for your losses. If your company goes bankrupt, your shares are held by your brokerage firm.  This is the company that owns the company.  The company owns your shares and you are held responsible for your loss.  Your investment is not your own.  If you sell short you are now the owner of the company.  This is different from selling short your shares, which is not your own investment.\n",

If you want to invest in something that is more liquid and not a savings account, you could put your money in an online brokerage account.

So, the average crash from 1923-1935 was 2.57% a year, so it was around 0.75% a year. Now, if you look at the data for the last 5 years, the worst crashes in 1961, 1960, and 16 years later in 1972-1984 were all at the bottom of the list, followed by 0.70% a year.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  In terms of being self employed, the question you're asking is: Is it better to be self employed or incorporate? This answer is a little complicated because there is a difference between being self-employed and being incorporated. In general, incorporating is a good idea because you can do it without paying corporate taxes. It gives you a lower cost basis in your business because you can sell your business for less money if it goes under. In addition, you may be able to deduct your costs for tax purposes. As an example, consider a business you do on your own, which is a very low-cost hobby. You're selling it for less money than you made on the hobby. If you incorporate it, you'll have to pay corporate taxes on that profit (assuming you're a contractor). If you incorporate, you'll pay tax on that profit regardless of if you sell it as a hobby or you keep it for a profit.\n",

      " Answer:  I've done this before. If you don't have a large enough Roth IRA to do so, it's worthwhile investing in something like the S&P 500 ETF. It tracks the stock market closely enough that you can get exposure to it. The S&P 100 is a much better bet. I would suggest you do that.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I am a bit confused about why you're not considering an unsecured loan. You could take a car loan to pay off the loan on your house, or you could invest in a house and use the money from there to pay off the car loan. This is what the bank does with a car loan.  You pay off the car, and then use the money from the car loan to pay for the house. The only problem you have is that the car is not secured.  If the car was sold at a loss you have to have the money from the sale.  If you don't, you can't buy the car.  This is the only risk that you take.\n",

The reason is that the prices are driven by the same factors: the price of the stock and the price of the underlying. So even if you can buy shares at the same prices at the same time of the year, your price will always be higher because it is the same factor that is driving the prices: the underlying stock price.\n",

      "If I pay taxes on my earnings, would someone also pay taxes on the same earnings if I subcontract them and pay a share?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  I think you are missing the fact that in this situation the \"employee\" pays the taxes and in this case the \"subcontractor\" pays the tax.  The employer's share is the \"subcontractor\" and his share is the \"employee\". If your share of this company is $10,000,001, you'd pay $100,011 in taxes, not the employer's $10,500.  If the employer pays $5,000 and you pay $10,101, you will be the \"subcontributor\" and the employer will be \"employee\".  If the employment contract specifies that the subcontractor is not to be paid more than $10,999, the employer is supposed to pay the subcontractor more than $11,001. If you were to pay yourself the same amount of money, you would still be considered the \"subcontsubcontractor\" and not the \"subcontessor\" and the employment contract would say so.\n",

It is usually triggered when you enter the market. It means that if the market price is reached before your order is executed, you will be paid the amount of the stop loss. It is very useful when you are investing in a large fund. For example, a fund like Vanguard's Total Stock Market which has 400 stocks. If the fund was not designed to invest in individual stocks, then there is no such thing as a hedge, as it is just a bunch of random numbers.\n",

The exchange fees are low (2% to 5%), and the commissions are minimal. The one thing I would say to keep an eye on is that FxFair is a small company.

It's just over 5% but I think it will get there in the next few years. I would look into a 529, or a Roth 401k, and I'd also consider an IRA for the 529.  The IRA is a way to put some of your money outside of the 401(k) and 403(b).  I'd put $2000 in a Roth IRA and invest it in a mutual fund.  Then I'd put the remaining $200 into a 5 year treasury bond fund.  If you're not sure how much you should put in a 401K or Roth IRA you might want to look at putting $500 in a traditional IRA.

Vanguard is a brokerage firm that charges you a flat fee for doing business with them.  The fund is managed by a group of people with lots of experience in different areas of the stock market.

So you are trying to get the tax reduction. If you buy 100 stocks, you would have a tax liability of $5,000.  The tax loss is $500.  You can offset this loss by purchasing 100 more stocks.

You will still have to pay the interest on the mortgages you take out in 2016 and 2017.

I showed the letter to the bank teller. I explained the situation.

If you don't plan to live in the house for 20 years or more, it's worthwhile paying extra on the mortgage to avoid paying interest. That being said, the question of whether you should pay extra is one of personal preference. The mortgage rate will have a huge impact on the mortgager's ability to find a mortgage for you.

      " Answer:  This can affect share prices, but generally, it is not as relevant as how many people are interested in it.  When companies are buying back stock in the hopes of making it more valuable to their owners, it can sometimes have a negative effect.  The reason that they are doing this is because they want to raise money, so that they can do something more useful with the money.  If the company doesn't do something useful with the money, it may have a negative impact on share price.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  The best benefit is to get tax deferred investments.  The main benefit to getting tax deferred is that you can get tax-free returns if you are invested in a Roth IRA.  This is called \"premium tax deferred accounts\".  If you get a tax-deferred account, then your taxes are deducted on your first $10k and you pay no taxes on the rest of the money.  That $10k is now taxed at 15% (10k+15%) and then 15% more.  If you do not invest in a Roth ISA, then your tax rate is 15% on $10k, so if you do not put any more than $10k in, then you are not taxed on the $10k.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  In general, it depends on the nature of the contract. If you're talking about a long-term contract or a long-term futures contract, the amount of profit you made is determined by the underlying asset price.  The underlying asset price will be the value of the underlying asset plus the premium paid to the seller of the contract.  If you have to pay someone else for the underlying asset price of $100,000, you would be making a profit of $2000.  If the underlying asset price is $100 and the seller of your contract pays $100 for the underlying asset, you would be $200 in profit, and $200 for the seller of that contract.  (That's not the whole story, of course.)  It all depends on the nature and price of the underlying asset.\n",

      "Purpose of having good credit when you are well-off?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  It is very important for people with good credit to have good credit.  If you have good credit, you can borrow at a very low rate and have your debt paid off in less than 5 years.  If you can't borrow at a low rate, you can still borrow at a higher rate and you will be able to pay it back sooner or later.  So you should have a good credit score, because you will have access to loans at a lower rate.  Your employer is probably giving you a lot of benefits that you might not be able to get elsewhere.  You can have an office full of people that you will not be able to contact if you have a low credit score.  This is especially important if you are on the west coast.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I just did the calculation for 2014 (from this year's 2015 version) and the results were in my favor. I also wanted to point out that the \"total rent\" is 33.8% lower than the 2012 year. I was able to get a total of $808 per month. That's 10% more money. But it does include the cost of electricity. So I'm at $705/mo. The difference is 20%. If you include electricity, it's $115. If you add insurance, it's nearly $150. So if you were in the 1999-2001 years, the difference would have been $705 per month. So the 20% increase would have been $662. That's a $225. I didn't include taxes, so I'm at a $53.6% increase.

For the purpose of this question, I will use the example of a beginner trader who is just starting out and doesn't want to spend a lot of time and effort on learning how to do things. The main difference in forex trading between beginner and professional is that you have to do things differently for different situations. For example, if you are trading forex you can buy or sell at different prices. In other words, you can make money, but it depends on what the market is doing. In other words you can lose money, but it will depend on what the market does. You can make a profit, but it depends how much you can get from it. You can lose a lot of money, but it is up to you how much you can lose.\n",

Secondly, you may have a credit card with a high balance or no balance. You will need to use that card to pay for a few things (including the grocery shopping). Thirdly, you should be prepared to pay the balance off in full every month, as it's a small balance and you are paying it in full. The minimum payment is $30. You will probably pay $300 or so in interest each month. The rest of the balance is a little lower. You can then get a regular credit card (or a card that will give you a card) that you can pay in full each month. It will probably cost you $50 to open it.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  Life insurance premiums are paid by the government on behalf of a state.  There are several advantages to the government paying a state. First and foremost is that the state is making money.  If you don't pay premiums, the government is going to have to pay it's employees (the insurance companies) or pay taxes.  The state also pays for things like fire department, libraries, police, etc.  It is pretty obvious that there is more to the life insurance business than paying the insurance companies.  It is a huge industry.  And since you are young, your parents probably have a large insurance company.  I doubt that any other state in the country is as small.  There is no real need for the government to make money off of the state.  It is the state's money that pays the premiums.  The state can do this through its budget or the state can pay for its own costs.   In addition to the government, the insurance company also makes money.  The insurance companies will probably pay you the full premiums.  If you get sick, or have a bad accident, or are in a car\n",

      " Answer:  The best advice I can offer is to make sure your credit is in order.  If you can, get a credit card with a 0% introductory rate.  That way you don't end up with a huge balance and being late on payments, or you get a chargeback on a card that you already used to purchase something. If you don't have a credit card, you can still get approved for a loan through your bank or a credit union.  If you're in a bad neighborhood, you might be able to get a loan through a credit union or a mortgage company.  I don't know about you, but I've never tried that. If you have a job, you can also try to make it a little easier on yourself.  If you don' t have a job, try to get a job.  I've found that working as a part-time security guard is enough to get you on your way to home ownership.  You'll have a job, and a place to stay, and a job to keep you from getting into trouble.\n",

      "Why doesn't Japan just divide the Yen by 100? \n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  I think the Japanese government is just using the Japanese system for calculating the value of the yen. The yen is the main reserve currency in the world.  So, the Japanese government would be better off just using the Japanese rate and counting the yen as 100 instead of 1.  So, if you take the current Japanese rate, then you'd have 2,700 yen and 2,710 yen, but instead of using 1.00127200 yen you'd have yen 1,555.055777785661157 yen.  So, you'd have more yen, but you wouldn't have 1.0240709795785453 yen, which is 1.04286855986667475 yen.\n",

If the house is a $500K house, your realtor will tell you that a $50K house is probably going to be worth more than a $200K house. If you look at the house as if you are going to buy and sell it over the next 5 years, the house is likely to have increased in value by the time you are ready to sell it.  There is no guarantee that a house will increase in value. If you are trying to buy a house that will increase in value, I would not go for it.\n",

      " Answer:  It depends on the merchant you use. For a credit card, the retailer will try to find the best price. The problem is, if you don't pay in full every month, you are risking getting hit with a 15% fee for every transaction you make. In the case of a debit card, the retaler can simply tell you \"We don't have the best rates on debit cards, so we have to charge you $X for every transaction you do not pay in full every time.\"\n",

      "\n",

I don't believe it is really secure enough for most people.  There are some good reasons for this.  For starters, there are security and fraud risks.  A security guard at the bank is likely to know you better than the bank.  If you are a very easy target for thieves, they will be much better at stealing your money than you.  There is little to no risk that they will get into your password.  In fact, they probably won't.  There is some risk of someone stealing your money, but not as much as you would be worried about.  You can do two-factor authentication through your phone (which they do) or through an app like Google Wallet or Gmail.  It's probably the best thing you can do.\n",

It also seems to be more of a risk.  It's hard to tell what you might do with the money in an employer 401, you could get into an interesting situation if they try to change things and you try to get rid of it.  If they really want to change things they could try to change the fees to what you are already paying.  I've had people try to do that with 401s, the fees are typically around 1-2% higher, but I think the change will make it easier to move to the right 401.  It depends on the company.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  In general, the price of a greeting card is driven by demand, and it's not necessarily an indication of how good it is.  In the case of the new Starbucks card, demand for a Starbucks card is driven by supply, and it'd be interesting to see how that plays out over the long term.  If demand is increasing, that could indicate a declining supply, which could indicate an increase in demand for a greeting card.  It could also be driven by the fact that the card is available for free at the grocery store, so people could have decided to use the card to shop at a store they normally use.  If the card is available only to those who actually use the card, that could indicate that it's not a good card, and that there's a demand problem.  This could also be an indication that there are no actual benefits to using the card, and that it is a gimmick.  The latter could be a result of a marketing gimmick.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  In India, if you sell shares, you will be taxed at the lower rate. You need to pay tax on the profits if you are not a business owner. However, if you are a business and not a self-employed person, you need to pay tax. You will pay taxes on the profits and capital gains. There are certain cases when you can sell stocks and capital gains can be taken. The taxes paid to the government will be less than the capital gains tax.\n",

      " Answer:  I'm going to assume you're not the sort of person who is comfortable with the risks and are looking for a way to protect yourself from the downsides of stocks, bonds, etc.  That's not a very wise approach.  So how can you convince them that you are not the sort of risk averse person they are looking for?  If you tell them \"I understand how to pick stocks and bonds and I don't want to take any of it personally\" and then ask \"What's the point in doing that if you can just pick stocks and get some decent returns?\" that is all you need to do to convince them that they need to get a different view.

      "When will the U.K. convert to the Euro as an official currency?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  In addition to what others have said, one reason to hold out hope is that the UK government is willing to make the transition to the new currency a step ahead of the rest of the world.  In the past, this would have required massive changes to the existing currency system, but with the advent of the euro it is possible to convert existing currencies without a huge hassle.  This is one of the more important benefits of the euro, and it is something that should be a priority for the UK as it is likely to become a large and influential player in international affairs.  The UK government would have to take on huge costs, so it would be a good idea to look for some other ways to raise the value of the UK currency, as the euro is unlikely to do much more than change the face of the economy.  For example, it is not uncommon for a large company to go public, and the Euro makes that easier for a company to raise money in Europe.  For example Microsoft was bought for £25 billion in 2013, but it is not a small company.  So it is possible to raise money for a company without much of a hurdle.  This could\n",

      "What happens to all of the options when they expire?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  In short:  When the option expires, you get to choose to either take the whole option or just the underlying asset.  There are some interesting implications:  Options that are bought are bought at market value (or close to it) and are sold at market value (which can be a premium, but it can be worth the price difference).  Options that are sold are sold at market price.  If you're willing to sell the option at a lower price, you get to pick what you're willing sell the option for.  You can choose to be covered by the premium or not.  In some ways, this is what the options market is like, since the premium is not guaranteed, and if you're willing or not to buy the option at a particular price, you may still be covered by the options market.  This is what happens when you exercise a call option.  It is called a \"crowd sale\" and is not allowed.  You get to choose your own price and sell your shares at that price.  The option holder doesn't care whether the market price is higher or lower, as the market price is the one you got to choose.\n",

If the company makes a large amount of money from the money that was taken from you, that would be money that could have been put towards your current employer.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  You can always contribute money to your Roth IRA account. You can always contribute money into a Traditional IRA. But you should always contribute money into your Roth IRA. I've found that many people get a better deal on a 401K with a Roth IRA. The 401(k) is a tax-deferred account so you can put money there for retirement. It's a good idea to contribute to a Roth IRA if you don't want to get a 403b plan. If you are under 50, you are not allowed to contribute to a Traditional ISA. You must contribute to a Roth or Traditional ISA only if you are over 50. This rule applies to any ISA that you contribute to. The ISA is designed to reduce your tax liability on your Social Security and Medicare taxes. So if you are under 65, you can contribute to a Tradional ISA. The 457 plan is a good choice for you. It is designed for people under 50. It's designed to reduce your Social Security and medicare tax liability. It's great\n",

I am not sure that you should buy shares of companies that have no history or that have no history at all. You can invest in mutual funds or ETFs. Mutual funds are the most popular form of investing. If you don't like the idea of being invested in a mutual fund, you could invest in index funds or ETFS. ETFS are the most popular. These investments allow you to invest in an index and can be diversified. There are several different kinds of index funds.

If you have an emergency fund that you would like to put in place, I would recommend building up that fund over time, rather than trying to start a savings account.   In the short term, this may be easier to do if you do not have an emergency savings account.  For example, I have an emergency account with $1000 in it that I can use if I need to.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  The cost of a commission depends on the stock price at which you purchase the option. The option is a derivative of the underlying security. It is also a part of the overall price of the security. The commission is calculated based on the current price of the underlying security and any changes in that price over time. If the stock price is $100, then the commission is $10. So if the price is $110, then the option price is $25.  There are two types of options, the call and the put. The first type of option is a call option and the second type of option is the put option. There is usually a difference between the two. A put option is a derivative. You are paying for the right to buy the underlying security with the option.\n",

In the UK you have a lot of different ways of paying tax, e.g. salary, NI, PAYE, 6.3% NI on a 3% wage, you could get a lot of different types of wages, and it is not likely to be very difficult to get a tax bill which is less than the IRS would expect, so I would suggest that you should consider whether it is worth your while to pay the IRS. If you are going to be doing something in the USA for the long term, you will likely need to pay tax in the USA. If you are only going to be in the USA for 3 years or less, you should be OK.\n",

      " Answer:  In a call option the option buyer pays the commission to the broker for the buying of the call option. The option buyer pays only one commission, while the option seller pays two commissions: the broker for buying the call and the buyer for the option. If a seller has to pay for buying the option, they can do it in the same day. The seller can sell the option in the same day as well, which means he's free to sell it to someone else. So that is a cost. If the buyer is the seller of the call, they can pay the broker for that too. The broker has to pay both commissions, so it is a cost, and it is possible that they don't want to pay the broker any commission at all.\n",

You should always ask the question, what will the pension scheme do for me in the future. If you are going to keep working, it's a good idea to consider the pension scheme which will take care of the pension.  If you don't have much time to think about it, you might get into a situation where you're left with no choice but to take a pension.  So be sure to take some time to research the pension scheme.\n",

      " Answer:  I am a realtor and a contractor. We are often asked this. \"I don't think you are being ripped off. You are just being unethical and are trying to game the system.

I was trying to get a mortgage for a 30 year fixed rate. I would be willing to sell the house for less than the current price. The realtor would get paid less, and I would get paid more. That's what happened. I have never heard of a realtor paying the buyer more, nor did I hear of one paying more.

Futures markets are a very risky way to make money on your investments. It is easy to lose it all.

If you can find a gold mine that is producing gold for you, and you can sell at a good price, you could probably make some money. But the real question is why you are in the market at all.  You are probably just trading for your next 5-10 years.  You don't have that much time in the market.  The only thing I know you can buy for 20 years at is a house.  And even then you will need a 100% down payment on a house.  You might be able to do better if you buy a home with 100k down, and the rest on a 15 year fixed.  You will get a 20% return on a 20 year fixed, but you will get 0% on a 10 year fixed.  And that 20% won't go away.  It will continue to increase for the next 10 years.

      " Answer:  It sounds like you are trying to get at what you are trying to calculate. I'd be tempted to use the following formula, which gives you the amount you are looking for, but I don't think it is correct.  I used the following formula to get the final number for cash flow: cash flow = 1.30 * amount of cash held over time * amount of dividends paid over time  Here's the result I got:  $1,405.25 cash flow  This formula is based on a very simple calculation: cash flow is a sum of all the cash you've earned over time, divided by all of your investments. So if you buy a stock and earn $100, then you get to keep $1,452.25. If you buy a stock in the future and earn $500, then your investment earns you $1,502.25 in cash. If you invest $10,000, then it's a $1,552.21 cash flow. This doesn't take into account divid\n",

As a side note, you may be surprised at the amount of debt you have, and how much you have to pay, and that you will get a new car, you have been saving to buy a car, and now that you have a car you are in the middle of a lease deal.  So, you may end up saving a lot on a car deal, and you may end up with a car, you can't use the car, but you do have a car.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  In addition to the general tax advantages of 401(k) plans, there are a couple of other reasons companies may offer such a plan. If the company is a large one, or if it has a large pension plan, or if it offers a health plan, or if they have a pension fund, or if they are large enough to offer a company match.  A lot of the above have been mentioned.\n",

      " Answer:  The answer to this question is very simple.  A bank's assets and liabilities come from its depositors, and depositors' money is deposited into the bank's bank accounts.  If you have enough deposits to cover the bills of your supplier and the bills of a few friends, you don't really need to think of it as a business.  It's just a matter of keeping track of the money you've deposited into your bank account and making sure you don't overdraw your account.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  In the case of stocks, it's not the risk of a single stock. It's the risk of buying multiple stocks. The same as the risk of buing 20 stocks. It is the risk of not buying enough of a stock. If you buy 20 stock, you have 20 risk, and the risk is in proportion to the amount you buy. If you buy only 10 stocks, you have 10 risk, and 100% of your risk is due to you. It is the same risk.\n",

      "My employer is switching 401k plan providers. How might this work in practice?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  I have had similar questions.  One way you might look at it is to look at it from your perspective.  You are saving money now but you have an extra $1600 to invest over the next few years.  You have been saving this for your retirement and the 401(k) is part of that savings.  If you look at this as a long term investment, you can expect to see a positive return from the investment over the next few decades.  If you can get better returns than your 401K you should invest in your retirement plan.  The big caveat I can see is that you will probably have a larger 401 K than you would have in the 403(b) plan you are in.  If you are going to be in this situation, I would strongly recommend a Roth IRA plan.  This gives you more options for investing than a traditional 401 plan.  It also gives you more flexibility in how you invest the money.\n",

      " Answer:  It's not an uncommon thing to have two or more transactions that result in the same result. It's usually not an indication that the transaction is the same as before. It's more of a signal that the two or more transactions result in different result, so you would need to look at the data in question to see the differences between the two. For example, if the first transaction result is \"I sold 200 shares of $10 stock\" and the second transaction result is \"200 shares sold to JoeTaxpayer\", then JoeTaxpater's first transaction will result in a sale of $10,000.00. The second transaction will result in the following: A $10,200.04 transaction result. In the second transaction result, JoeTaxpeter sold 20% of his holdings and sold 20,00 shares. So he has a net gain of $200.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I would recommend that you get a budget that you can live with, but that doesn't mean you need to spend money every day.  I would recommend you to start with setting up a budget that you are going to stick to.  If you don't have a budget, start by keeping track of where your money is going.  You will know if you are going to make more than you think, or if you are going into debt. If you are worried about being broke, you might want to set up a budget that is based on the amount of money you are going to have every month.  You could set up a budget of $2500 every month.  So if you have $250 every month, you have $2750.  Then you could set up a $50 budget each month.  Then you will have $3000 every month after you set up the budget.\n",

The other reasons are the usual: to prevent the currency from being manipulated to gain advantage over other currencies.  The reason for the Federal Reserve Bank to not be interested in a currency falling against other currencies in this case is because it would be in their interests to maintain the value of the dollar in the United States.\n",

PayPal is still paying you, the money is still there, but you will still have to pay your own bank. 2nd, PayPal is not the same as bank. PayPal is the business entity and is supposed to be able to handle the money and not just to transfer money. If a person does not know how to do that, he should go to the bank or the state.\n",

      "Smart to buy a house in college?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  This is a great question.  The questioner was asking if it is wise to buy a house.  If you are in the United States, you can get a mortgage for 10 years for 3.8% interest.  This is the \"standard\" mortgage.  In my experience, this is the best rate for the money.   The mortgage rate will go up, but if you are looking at a 15 year mortgage, you will save 3.8%.  The questioner did not address the fact that the mortgage rate can go up, but you can get the mortgage for a year or so at a discounted rate.  The question is, if you are in the U.S., will you get a 10 year mortgage?  If you do, then you will save a lot more money.  You will be paying a little extra per month in interest, but you will be paying less than a 30 year mortgaged.  This is a great way to save money on interest rates.\n",

      " Answer:  I am assuming that you have a large position in the company. I don't know how you got 300000 tokens in 2009, but it's not uncommon. So, you have a large amount of tokens in a company that has an uncommon valuation, and you have to sell them. In your case, you are selling 1000 tokens and selling 15000 tokens. You get the money from a buyer that buys 100 tokens for 100,000. Now the stock is up, so you get 150,001 shares for your $300,094.  That's 27% of your original investment. That's a big deal.\n",

I know that they will offer a loan for 15 years if you are not interested in refinancing.  That makes sense if you don't mind paying more interest than you would if you refinanced for a longer term.

When I sell them, they will charge $3, and if I buy 100 more, they will charge me $1. If the price of AAPL went down from $50, it would be because the broker is charging them $3, and the $3 they charge to the client are just the $3 they make from the brokerage.\n",

      " Answer:  The worldwide economy is growing rapidly. The US is not the only economy that is growing, as it has always been. China is growing rapidly and the UK is not far behind. But, we are also moving in the wrong direction.  In 1999, the global economy was $13.3 trillion. In 2000, it was $23.2 trillion. That means the global economy is growing, but it is not growing at the rate it should. In the last 10 years, the global economy has grown at 13% annually, compared to 2.7% for the entire 200 years. This means that our global economy has lost 13% of its growth, not 2%.  We are not even in the middle of a recession, and that has been going on since the late 1970s. This is not normal. In 1977, we were 23.4% over 25 years. Today, that is 13.7% and in 2014, it is 11.5% over 20 years\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  If you're going to use the card as a means of funding a car or home purchase, you'll want to pay off the card in full before you get a loan or refinance. If you're going on to apply for credit cards and other loans in the future, and you're going from 0 to 18 without much of a downpayment, the only thing you'll want is to make sure that you don't overdraw the card. If you do overdraw it, you'll have to pay interest. 18 is the perfect age to start a credit card because you'll get the most rewards.\n",

      " Answer:  Check the references on the site that you are going to trade with, and if the references are for the company that they are talking to you with, then you have probably had their company to call for some information.  I was once a broker and had a client from the firm where I was working call and ask for a few things from me, and when I answered I asked for proof that they had my SSN.  I was not the first one that had had this information and was not even the first one to have had that information.  It was a big red flag to me, and I went back to the broker and they said that this is not true, but I wanted to check with you.  They said they were going to check it out and if it worked, I could give them my SSN.   When I called the firm I had told them to call me and give me some proof that the information was not real, so they had given me a number of SSNs.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I think the answer is a little different from what has been said so far. I am assuming you have a fixed rate loan. If you put $5000 into a 10 year fixed rate mortgage, and you get it paid off at $112,000, and you do that at 3%, then your mortgage will be $432,004 in 20 years.  That is 52.88% annual return, or $162,001. If you are a variable rate mortgage with a variable rate, say a 30 year fixed rate, that means you will pay it off in 20.5 years.  So if you get paid off, it will be $240,000.  So if I put that same $500 in a 10yr fixed rate mortgAGE, I will get it paid off in 28 years, or $432.88.  You can get it done with less money, but it will be a longer time.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  In the case of \"priced in\", you're talking about the underlying price of the stock.  This is not necessarily the same as the price of the option contract.  For example, if you were to buy the option at $100 and the underlying stock price rose to $150 and then the stock price went back down, the option contract would no longer be worth $100. If you were to buy a stock at $10, and it rose to $120, then you'd have the option to buy it for $120 or to sell it for $150.  If the price was $100, then you would still be willing to sell at $105 for a loss.\n",

If the IRS refuses to send you the tax return in a timely manner, you can request the return be filed in a timely fashion, so that you don't pay a late fee.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  There is a reason why dividend paying stocks are so popular with investors. The company that pays the dividend gets the money from investors. In the past, the dividend was paid by the company as a cash dividend to shareholders and this is still the case. But that is not the case now. If you have a company paying dividends, that is not the only reason that they are so popular. The company can do a lot of things. The stockholders may vote to do so. Or they may sell off some of the company, or they may take a loan from the company. This may be a good thing for the company, or it may be a bad thing for the company. Either way, the company still pays the dividend.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  The most important thing to start with is a Roth IRA.  This is not a savings account, but is a place where you can invest.  The money in it can be used to pay for school, buy a house, buy stocks, etc.  It's all tax-deferred. You are allowed to invest money in other kinds of IRA's, but you can't put money in one.  So that makes it a savings account. The best way to start is to invest in a stock mutual fund.  This is an investment, not a savings plan.  It will give you exposure to a lot of stocks and it will provide you with some diversification.  In the future, if you want to buy more stocks, you can always move it to a mutual fund or ETF.  This is how you start.  You will be investing for the long term.  You will need to get used to the volatility of stocks.  The stock market has a lot of ups and downs.  You can buy low, sell high, and get out.  The most important thing is to get used to it.\n",

      "How much house can a retired person afford\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  Your question is a little vague so I will assume you are a middle class citizen of the United States.  In the US the median home price is $45k and in many places that number is closer to 50k.  So if you are retired you will pay 45k a year in property taxes.  50k/year for $1400 a month?  You will have to save up 40% of that in the next 20 years to live comfortably.  That is what most people do.  So in 20 years you will have 40k of equity.  And that's a 1% gain.   In the US it seems that the average home price is around $140k.  That is the amount of money that you will need to save for a house and if you are retired that number can be much higher.  In many places people make $300k a year and can live in the house for 40 years.  So if your question is really about \"what is my maximum income I can expect to receive from a home?\" then this is a good question to ask.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  There are a few things I would like to point out in this case.  You're basically making 400K, and in the US, you can get 10% off taxes on income from your ISOs.  That's a good start, and you can look for the company that provides the ISOs to see if they're offering a similar discount to the public.  If they are, you might just be stuck with 400,000 instead of the 10% discount.  I think it's pretty safe to assume that the ISO tax is lower than the federal tax on stock, so the 400k is probably the right amount to make this a profit.  If you're worried about paying taxes, I'd still go with the option.  If you are really worried about your tax liability, and you want to be sure to make the ISO tax a profit, I'd suggest that you go with the option, and not the taxes.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I think this is a pretty interesting point of view, but it's worth pointing out that, in general, currencies are not necessarily weaker.  In general currencies are weaker because they are not the most stable of medium-term instruments.  Currencies, like many other financial instruments, have a range of use cases.  In a variety of situations (from cash transfers to international remittance transfers) currencies are useful.  They are also useful for short-term (cash flow) emergencies and for some other non-value-add uses.  For example, it can be useful in some situations for money laundering (in the form of money laundering), if the government does not have access to funds, but you can provide some of the money (which can be a lot).  For the latter situation, I would suggest using a currency that has access to local funds, but which is not easily laundered, or that can be easily laundered but is not accessible to local funds.  That is, in this case I think the currency is weaker, as it can be hard to get money laundering funds to access local funds.\n",

      " Answer:  It's not true. The question is whether you'll be able to buy a property in the UK if you move to another country. I would suggest that if you are not from the UK you can't buy a property in a country that you are not resident in. You would only be able to buy property in a country if you have moved there before or you've been there for 2 years or less. It sounds like your friend has been there for less than 2 years. That's fine, it doesn't mean that it is unlawful. If you can't afford a property in the EU, you can't own a property. The only exception is if you are on a student visa, or if you have been in the UK for 1 year or less. If you're a student you are not allowed to buy a property, unless you're studying part-time.

You cannot withdraw from a Roth Ira if you are younger than 59 and have not earned enough to pay tax on it. So there are only two possible scenarios that are not good for you:  (1) you are younger than you want to be and you cannot withdraw from it and it will be taxed as if you are 59.  (2) you are older than you want to age but you cannot withdraw from a retirement account. So you need to make a decision.\n",

You have the potential to make money in that stock, but I'd be very surprised if it didn't drop by 50% or more.  There is a lot more money out there for the right reasons.  So take the loss, learn from it, and use it as a learning experience to make better decisions.  If you learn something, that's worth a 40% drop.  You can use that as a learning experience.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  The wash sale rules have nothing to do with whether two ETFs have identical prices.  There is nothing in the wash sale rules that says that ETFs must trade in the same market for the wash sale to apply.  Wash sale rules are only used when there is a material change in the share price of the ETF. For example, if you are selling your position to another investor and the share price of your ETF falls, you would need to sell your position to another person in order to maintain your original investment of $10000. If you buy another ETF, you would have to wait 60 days for the wash-sale rule to apply.  In the end, you are still buying and selling ETFs in the same market.\n",

      "Why naked call writing is risky compare to Covered call?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  The answer to this question depends on how you interpret the stock.  For example, suppose the stock went from $10 to $120 in a few weeks.  If the company goes under and you own shares in the stock, then the company has gone down by $20.  If the stock goes from $100 to $1000, then the stock has gone from $10 in a matter of days to $10.  The stock could be worth less than the original $100.  So if the company goes under, the stock will lose $20, which would mean you will have a $15 gain on the call.  You might not be able to recover your original $10 investment.  In that case, you could be left holding stock worthless.  You might be better off if you wait until the stock goes back up to $10, but you would then lose $20.\n",

You will then need to refinance. The mortgage you are currently getting will have a new interest rate and you will have to pay the new rate. The new rate could be lower than the original rate and if you have an adjustable rate mortgage, you might be able to pay the new mortgage off sooner.\n",

In the long run, you are going to get a better return if you can invest that money in a good company.  If you invest in an S&P500 fund, you will get 3% on average over the 30 year period, versus the 0.2% that an institutional investor would get.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I think I understand your confusion. It is not true that you are comparing apples to apples. A Masters degree will give you a much greater salary than a college degree. You are getting a lot more salary for the same amount of work. This is the main reason for higher salaries for Masters degrees. Also, you get paid more for your time in a Master degree, but the amount you are paid depends on the university. If you go to a school in the U.S. it will be paid based on the curriculum of the degree you choose. The amount paid is usually based on the total cost of the degree. If you go for a bachelor degree in business at a school in the US you would get paid $5,000 less than you would pay at a school in Australia. The reason for this is that the curriculum at Australia schools is less. They have to compete with other universities in order to be competitive. This is why Australian universities are often ranked very high in the world. So in order to compare you would need to do a lot more work, and a lot more money.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I think the best way to think about this is that when there are many stocks out there with a high level of volume (large volume) they are almost always traded very heavily.  That makes them a very volatile stock. If you're trying to buy or sell options on this stock, your best bet is to wait until there is a large level of volume and then look at the prices of the options on the market.  If you're able to get a good deal on your options, you're probably better off with those rather than trying to buy/sell a bunch of options.\n",

      " Answer:  I would say that you need to learn about investing, and how to do it.  A smart money is someone who is making the money to invest in the market.   If you are looking for a good investment to make some money in, look at index funds and ETFs.  These can be very risky investments.  Invest in index funds, but look at the performance of the index.  It should be in the 50s, 60s.  You can sell your index fund, and invest the money in an ETF.  These will give you the same performance, and some other things.  If you invest $1000 in index funds and get 60% growth, you have a nice return on your money.  However, if you get $100 in stock market returns, you'll be better off if you buy ETFs.

If you take 25 of the 4 dividends, then you get 1 dividends.  That is 25/4*3 is 32 dividends, or 32 dividend each year.  I know the maths is tough to grasp, but that is how it is done.  The 1/3 is just the percentage.  The 25 dividends would be more like 25% of the annual income.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  As I understand it, you have three different debts - the loan, the house, and the car. The debt you have on the house is called a home equity line of credit. If you use the money to pay off the car, the car is considered debt. You have to pay the money off the car. It's not a bad debt, but it doesn't have much of an effect on your credit score. The loan is a loan, which is a type of debt, but not necessarily a bad one. It's a loan with the intention of making you whole. The car is a car. It'll last you forever. It's just a debt. If you use it for a long time and pay it off, you'll be able to sell it, and it'll be worth a lot more than the $10,000.  The car isn't necessarily a bad debt. It's still a debt. But you're still paying the loan off. So it's not a loan. The car is still a loan.  The car is still debt, but you don't owe the\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  It doesn't sound like it, so I'll guess you are talking about a new car.  If you are buying a new car you are most likely going to have to pay more than the market rate for the car.  If your local dealer doesn't want to give you a better price they may charge you a little higher.  You can also try calling a few other dealers in the area to see what their prices are.  If you find a good price on a new car you may be able to find a good deal on financing.  If you have trouble finding a good deal you may also try to refinance your loan.  In that case you will probably have to pay the difference, but if you refinance you will have to pay more.  Your car will have to be paid for in full every month until it is paid off.  You can always get a better rate by negotiating with the finance company, but they are unlikely to do it.  If you do have trouble finding a deal that you like, you can try to talk to the salesman or a manager at the finance company.  They will be able to help you.  If they\n",

For example, if you have a company and a car that you'd like to sell, and you would pay $20,000 for each, you'd need $20,500 in order to get the cost basis, because you'd pay $1,250 for the $20,400.

You might also consider looking at buying a house you can move into as soon as you find a place, as that will avoid the temptation to get a new car every 6 months. If you are planning on moving and your current job has a similar arrangement, it would be worth checking if you can transfer over your existing pay to the new job. This would be one way to save on your current salary, as you will have the same basic job and benefits, but your salary would be split up to make it more affordable for you. You could consider switching jobs to a different type of job to avoid being forced to transfer to the new company.

You'll want to apply for a loan in advance, of course. You will need to have proof of your income and the amount you are paying towards the loan.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  You are talking about the stock price of the company, not the market cap of the company.  The market cap of the stock is the price at which the stock price is listed on the market. The market cap of a company is a number that you will find listed on the last trading day of a stock's annual report. It is a reflection of how much the company is worth. A $10 stock might have a market cap of $10 million, but might be trading at $1.6 million. If it did not have a market cap, it might be trading for a little less than that.  As to the revenue from the company's business, you might ask. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it is worth more.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  The answer depends on how you filed your return. If you're single, then it is likely you have the same income on the tax return. If you are married, then it's probably you'll be splitting up your taxes, and your wife's loss is offset by your gain. If you have no income at all, then you have two separate tax returns. You would likely be splitting the tax return between your wives tax return. I'm not sure why this would make much sense.  You can probably ask your tax return person about this, but you may need to talk to a licensed tax adviser, who can tell you how to go about this.\n",

So if you want to break even, you would need to have a return of 9% (10% - 0.1%/10%). The insurance cost should be the same for both investment and insurance.

      " Answer:  As you can see from the chart, the merger of Microsoft with Apple has a very large impact.  It is a good question and one that has been asked, so I will address it. Microsoft acquired the company, and Apple acquired the majority of the shares. The shares of Microsoft were valued at $150 billion.  Apple is worth over $300 billion.  If they merged, that would put Apple's shares at about $300.  Microsoft's shares are still at $200 billion, but the value of Microsoft's shares will be significantly reduced.  That makes Microsoft's share price 125% lower than it was 2 years ago. The share price is currently about $50.\n",

If you're looking at it from that perspective, you need to consider the cost of doing things the old fashioned way, i.e.: cash flow.  That is, if the company has to pay a dividend to shareholders, and if the company is going to get hit hard by an acquisition.

I'd argue that if you want to diversify your portfolio and have more than a few thousand dollars to invest in individual stocks, index funds can do better than you would with a mix of stocks and bond funds.   There are many index funds available through mutual funds, such as Vanguard's S&P 500 index fund.

The futures mark to money concept is more important to understand the concept of the underlying asset. For instance a call is a derivative of a stock. If you buy a call on a stock that trades for 10$ then you can expect the price to rise 10$ from now till the date you want to sell the call.

      " Answer:  The question is \"why do you think that is?\". Why do you think that people don't think it is a good idea to invest in ETFs and mutual funds?  You can invest in mutual funds and ETFs because you are looking to buy a \"hot\" stock. You want to buy a stock that has gone up recently and you think it will go up again. But the problem is, the stock market is always down. And if you buy a stock that is up in the past 2 weeks, it could be going down. So what do you do? Buy another stock, right? But how? It's a lot of work. If you want to buy a hot stock, you need to know what to buy and when to buy it. You can't just buy a stock that you know is going to go up. If you don't have a good idea of what to buy, you will end up missing out on the opportunity because you are looking for a hot stock.\n",

This can be advantageous for a few reasons: The car will be less expensive to you to finance through a refinance company. They are more likely to give you a low interest rate on a refinance. You can refinance a car and get a lower interest rate if you can find a loan that pays off early. This is called an automatic loan.

      " Answer:  It depends on the property you buy. It's worth noting that the question is asked on the question of whether or not a property is a good deal if the property is sold for a profit in the future. This depends on your local market. If the house has depreciated, you are probably paying more for it than you should. If the house is depreciating, it's probably not a good deal. It also depends on whether you're buying a house for the long term. You'll be buying for the long term anyway, as a home is generally a long term investment, and you can expect that your house will appreciate for the long term, and you will get a fair return for your money.  The most important thing to remember is to have a realistic expectations of the house. You're paying for it, not for the future.

For example, if I have $50,000 and invest it in a stock, I can get back $2,500, but I will only get 2.5% on the stock price, which is $50,352. If I invest the same amount in a CD or a bond, I can get a higher rate of return, which is $2,567.00.\n",

If you can't pay, you can't afford it. If you are looking to buy a house, you will probably find that you need a loan because you are buying a house and you are in a tight spot.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I would say the age of 15, but that is just me.  My father had a very similar experience, and my own personal experience.  At 15 he decided to stop saving and put the money in his stocks.  In 20 years he was 18.  At 25 he decided to invest in real estate.  In 10 years he was well on his way to retirement.  In 30 years he was working on a mortgage.   In the end, he got his first job at 18, and he never looked back.  I can see how it would be easy to get into a situation where you need money at a young age.  I can also see how it would make a lot of sense to start at 15.  I would encourage you to start saving as soon as you are able.  Don't let the money sit in a bank account.  Start putting money in a Roth IRA.  It is an investment vehicle, and it is free money.  If you want to put some money into a Roth IRA you are young.  I don't know if you can do\n",

I know that the stock market doesn't have that much to do with your life, but the market can still go up or down.  So if you have a 1% chance that it will go up, then do it. I personally would not put the money into a savings account.  Instead, put that money in the market.  But if you really think you will be in the market for a long time, then put some money in an IRA.  Just be aware that a lot of money is in a stock market and a lot of money goes up and a lot of people lose money.  And that the stock market goes down when people have to sell.  So you're just throwing money away.  (I would recommend against the stock market.  But I know it's hard to see that from your situation, so it's not that I can tell you to go with the market.)\n",

You can buy stocks with dividends that pay a higher price than you expect them to, but if you are not sure that you will need to do so in the near future, then the dividend yield is a good thing.

You have to add the 0.1% on the balance. The bank charges you 2.5% for this. So, in order to be charged the 0.2% on the balance, the bank charges you 1.25% on the amount in the account.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  This is an interesting question.  I don't think the Cash account is an option.  The merchant's only option would be to go to the bank, write a check, and deposit it.  There are a number of risks.  There are other ways of transferring money that would be less risky.  If you're a bank teller, you may be able to tell if the transaction is fraudulent by checking with the bank.  I would check with a bank teller and check with a financial adviser.  If you are the only person that is paying with a Cash account, it can be very easy to write a check and not realize that it is not a cash transaction.  The bank has to make sure that the funds are transferred in the right form.  I would recommend you ask the bank, but that may be difficult.  The bank may not be aware that you are using a Cash account.\n",

In general, they can limit the amount of your employer's contribution, but it can't be more than 25% of your compensation. In the US, this is called the 25% rule, and it has nothing to do with your 401(k). Your employer is doing it to protect you from your employer' s liability for a large pension.

So if you buy US dollars and they go down, it's possible you will lose money.  But you will not lose money in the long run.  If you bought US dollars, and they went down, you would lose money in the future. If your country's exchange rate is higher than the previous exchange rate, it's because you are buying US dollars at a lower exchange rate than the previous exchange. If your currency is going up, it means that you are buying foreign currencies at a lower exchange ratio.\n",

It depends on the type of house and your ability to make the monthly payments.   You can ask the seller to sell you a house and buy it from you for a higher price.  You will likely have to pay more than you want, and the seller is usually unwilling to sell you a high price house.  If you have the money, you can buy a house on the open market.  That is the most effective method.  If you can afford a house, you can buy it.  If you are in the US, you can buy on the open market and have your credit checked.

That means the buyer and the seller are both agreeing to the terms and conditions.  This is why you don't want to do this yourself.  If you're the seller, you're agreeing to the seller's terms and conditions. So, you can go this route.  But you have to consider that seller is going to get upset if they don't get what they want.  They could get you to go back to court and try to force you into buying.  They could also try to force you to buy the house with a loan from someone else.  Or, they could try to force you, and then you'll be out of the house if they win.  If this is an unrelated transaction, you should probably be happy to have the house.  The seller's attorney will be able to help you through this if you're willing to pay him.  And if this is a related transaction, you might be happy\n",

      " Answer:  I've never heard of the concept of \"Dollar Collapses\" but I think you should at least learn about it. Dollar Collapses are a common occurrence when investors feel that the economy is going to take a major hit. In the United States, the 1929-2009 period was considered \"Dollar Collapse\" and some of the \"dollar collapses\" that you are describing in the 1970's are examples of this. If you want to learn more about the Dollar Collapsing and how it happened in the 1800's, here is a link to a good article about it.\n",

Net income is a measure of how much you have to pay to buy stock.  Net income is also a measure of the net profit of the company. So you have to look at both to get the net income.

      "My friend wants to put my name down for a house he's buying. What risks would I be taking?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  The risks are not that high. The first thing to consider is that you need to be sure that you will be able to make a reasonable payment for a property that you intend to buy. You need to check with the seller to see if you will be able make a reasonable payment, and whether they are prepared to pay you a higher price if you fail to do so. If the seller has been unreasonable, you can always try to negotiate, but it's probably not worth your while. You can always try to get a mortgage. But I doubt that you will have to do this. You are in a good position financially. If you have a good job, your income will be relatively stable and you will be able take out a mortgage with a reasonable rate, and that will give you a lot of flexibility.  So you should do it. You will be buying a home and you will get a lot of flexibilities. You don't have to worry about whether you are able to pay your rent or not, and you will be buying at a good price.\n",

      "How will Brexit affect house mortgages?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  I would say that house prices should be more stable now that Brexit has happened, and that prices should be stable in the medium term. However, there are still quite a few things that could happen that could cause house prices to go up. For instance, the banks are going to be more willing to lend you money as you are going to be leaving the EU. So, the banks are not going to be so happy about the situation and will want to reduce their rates and make you pay less money to borrow money. The bank could go to make some money and make some more money to pay back their depositors. Or, they might be forced to close their branches and reduce their rates. So, the bank would need to do a lot of things to make sure that they stay in business. This is why it would be wise to hold your mortgage until Brexit has been concluded.\n",

      " Answer:  The difference between the two depends on what you mean by the term.  If you are talking about the difference between debt that you can pay off in a timely manner and debt that you cannot pay off in a manner that will be advantageous, then a good debt is one that you will pay off quickly.  You can make your payments on a good debt, so long as you are not overpaying.  If you have a good debt with an interest rate of 5% and you pay off your good debt in one year, you can expect to pay 5% of the original amount plus 5% of your next monthly payment.  If you do not pay off the good debt in 1 year, you will owe the bank 5% of that amount plus the 5% of next monthly payment plus 5% from the original amount.  The next month you will owe 5% of $500 plus $500 of the next monthly payment and $500 from the original amount plus $50 of the next payment plus $50 from the original monthly payment plus $5 from the original amount and you\n",

      "Are AAA private-sector corporate bonds safer than government bonds?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  Bonds have a lot of risk. The main risk factor for bonds is the risk that the issuer of the bond has to default. If a government defaulted on its obligations, it would be a bad thing for the economy, but the risk is that they can do so for the same reason that a bank could do so for the people's savings: it's riskier. The other risk is that the issuer defaults on their obligations, and they'll be in trouble for it. The risk of default can be very high. The risk of being in trouble for failing to meet their obligations can be very high, too.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  In addition to what has already been said about the benefits of life insurance, here are a few more reasons to do this: In addition to the obvious benefits mentioned above, life insurance can be useful for a few other reasons. For example, if a child is a victim of a tragic event such as a car accident, a parent or guardian can get help from a policy that pays for funeral expenses. The child may not be able to pay for it himself, and may need a family member or friend to pay for it. A parent or guardian is able to take a step back and see things from the child's perspective, which can be very helpful in dealing with grief. Finally, a child who is the victim of a traumatic event can benefit from life insurance to cover a few other things. For example, a parent may need help from a policy to help care for a sick or disabled child. In this case, a child insurance policy can help a parent or guard\n",

It's just as easy to make money with gold as it is with platinum.  I've never heard anyone talk about platinum as an alternative to gold, or even as a \"better\" alternative to platinum. I'm not sure if this is because platinum is harder to mine, or because platinum miners are not as successful as they were in the past.  I'm not a platinum miner, and I don't plan on ever becoming one, so I can't say anything about it, but it's not like platinum is a dead metal.

I've tried that once and it was very helpful.  If you haven't received a repair from your vendor, then you will need to contact the manufacturer and try to get a new one. If you have a warranty, you will need to try to get the manufacturer to change it, so that you can get it repaired.  You can try calling the manufacturer's customer service. I know you didn't mention it, but I'd try that too. If you don't have a warrantied computer, you might try to see if you can get a refund from your bank. You should always check that.

It is the price of your confidence that you're in a position to buy the bond at any point during the duration of the bonds.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  You're correct in that you can take a loan and use it for something else.  For example, you might buy a car at a lower price than the interest rates you are currently paying on it.  However, you're still paying interest on that car and your loan is akin to paying interest on a loan. If you're worried about how you're going to handle a job loss or other emergency, you might take on a new job that pays more than your loan.  That might also save you money in the long run.  If you have a new car, you might be tempted to take on a loan and put off a new car until you get the loan paid off.  This can be done because you're not in the situation where you have a car payment, and you have the money to pay for a car, so you don't have to worry about having to take on a new loan. However, that's only true if you have money to pay for the new car, and the car is akin to a new loan.  If you don't, you could have the loan paid off and you'll have money to pay off\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  High theta options have a lower probability of being bought and sold at the same time. So, if you're short an option, your price can be as high as you'd like to see it.  If you're long an option, your prices can be lower than you'd like.\n",

      " Answer:  I would not suggest pre-paying private loans unless you have a very high debt/earned income ratio. It seems you are trying to be \"investment-oriented\" and have a high debt/income ratio.  Your question has some good points that I would like to address, but first I want to make a few clarifications: The only thing I can tell you that I haven't heard anywhere else is that you should get your debt paid off as soon as possible. That is probably the most important thing. The sooner you pay off the loans the sooner you will be able to save for the future. That is what you are really looking for.\n",

      " Answer:  There's a good reason for this. It is a simple calculation that takes into account dividend reinvestment plans. In 2012, the S&P 500 was 37% dividend reinvesting. The S&P 400 was 40% dividend reinving, and the S&P MidCap 400  was 38% dividend reinversting. I am sure you will find some stocks with 5% or even 6% dividend reinveying, but I would imagine that is not the case for all stocks.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  The answer depends on your business model and the tax treatment.  If you're selling your domain, and then use it for your own business, you'll be considered an employee and have taxes due.  If you sell your domain for personal use, you'll pay taxes on the profit, and you'll pay the ordinary income tax on it.  If you rent out the domain, you'll also pay taxes on that.  If you use the domain for your business, and then later sell it, you'll still pay the taxes on the sale, but if you do the sale yourself, the capital gain taxes are lower.  You'll probably pay more on the taxes for selling a domain to someone else, because you'll be selling it for the business.\n",

You can send the check by paypal to your friend or by mail. This is known as check transfer. This is very easy, and the only downside is that the money you send to your friend might not be withdrawn immediately. There is no way you can transfer money to someone else immediately. There is some time period where the money is withdrawn. There is no time frame to transfer money in this scenario.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  Its a simple question of supply and demand. In theory, you can buy and sell currencies at any time you want and sell or buy at any time you like. In practice, it is not like that.  The most recent price change is usually the last price you will see of any currency, and even if you want to change your mind, you have to wait until the next trade closes.  The reason it is so difficult to predict this is that currencies have been moving very slowly in price.  Most currencies are still very young.  There is a lot of time between the last trade and when you want to buy or sell.  You cannot simply jump in and out of currencies, it is not even possible to do so for large currencies.  If you want to buy a large currency you will have to wait until it reaches your desired level of value.  If you are willing to wait you can actually do this, but you will probably have a hard time doing it for a currency which has just reached its maximum level of value.\n",

However, you're making a mistake:  She is the only one you know that can afford to own the condo.  The fact that she's renting from you is not proof that she can afford it.  She could lose the money she saves on interest and still have no home.  And even if she can afford it, the rent will still be higher than she can afford it for herself.  She may not want to sell her house in a year or two and you may end up owing more than you think.   I would recommend that you get your money'\n",

      "If she can afford to buy a condo, that is the first thing you should do.  She can do this because of the tax deduction.  If you get her to rent it, she will have the money to buy the house.

      " Answer:  This is different from tax in the US. In the US, the IRS is very helpful in finding out what you are owed, which can be quite confusing. In the US you need to pay tax on the profit you made in stocks. However, in India the IRS does not really need to know. You will receive a notice from your broker if you decide to pay a portion of your capital gains tax. The broker will send you a notice and you will be notified by the IRS of the amount you have paid in stock.  You have to pay tax on capital gains, which is a tax on the sale of a stock. It is not just about taxing the sale of a security. It is also about taxing any portion of the gain. You can only claim gains on gains.\n",

      " Answer:  The risk/reward ratio is the inverse of the price.  If a company is undervalued and/or underperforming, it is very easy for it to go up, even when it has no real reason to go up. This is the classic \"fair price\". The price is a reflection of the value the company has and will have in the future.  If you buy shares in Apple and it goes up to $100, it is because the value of the company has increased. If it goes down to $105, it is because of the market believing the company will never make another $100 million or more. This is what happens when the price is too low.  When it's too high, the value of the stock drops.\n",

But if you don't have a serious accident, the insurance company can simply deny coverage and you are not at risk for liability. I am not sure if the premiums you pay are lower than they would be in a non-insurance scenario.  In the United States, there are a number of companies that will give you coverage for less than you would pay with no coverage.\n",

If you sell at $250, then you will pay capital gains taxes, so the gain is greater. If you sell and then buy back a few days later, the gain will be smaller.

I can tell you that if I wanted to send you my credit card information to a private company or bank that I would have to ask for it in writing. You don't have that option with your bank. I've never had an account that was stolen from my card. The only time I have ever used a bank card for a purchase, I had to ask the banker what the card was for. They were never able to say anything. They did ask the bank if I could call them back later if they were able to help me with the problem. If you use a credit card or debit card or check, you'll have the same problems as always. If you don't have a credit card, then you can never have a problem. It is possible that someone could steal from you and make you feel that you need a credit card or have an account with that bank, but I doubt that it will happen.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I don't know if it is possible to do that, but if you have any assets and don't want to sell them you can put them in a fund.  For example you can put your retirement savings into a S&P fund.  The S&P fund will be managed by a professional and will invest the money in various companies.  So for example if you put 5% of your retirement saving into a S&p fund it is 5% that you will receive.  If you put your retirement into a CD it is 0.01% of your retirements that you will receive, so it is a win/win. If you want to go even further, you can also put money in a 100% S&P fund and still have a lot of cash.  This is called the \"long-term bond fund\".  So if you put 10% of your retires savings into a bond fund you will receive a 10% return on your savings.  That's not as good as the 5% return, but that's better than nothing.\n",

They have had 75% return during that period, and have outperformed their S&P 100 index by 25% over the same period.

I would put my money in US equities, US debt, or US stocks.  The other good idea is to diversify your investments into foreign currencies.  There is a lot of discussion about the effect of inflation on foreign currencies. There is little information out there.  If you look at the US dollar as a basket of currencies, it is very similar to the Japanese yen.  If you take the yen as the basket of currencies you can look at the effect of inflations on it.\n",

If the issue is that you're not the person who is issuing the shares, then yes, you're probably responsible for filing the paperwork. But you're not actually the one who bought the shares. Your broker probably sent out the form to the bank to determine whether you are or aren't responsible. The broker probably sent it back to the bank and they probably did it from the same bank that you have an account with. If you are the one issuing the shares (or at least you are responsible for issuing them), then you can issue them from your broker and your broker will likely handle the paperwork and issue the shares. But if you are not the person who issued the shares and they sent them to your broker, you probably can't do that. You can only issue them from your account, not from the broker's.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  You should calculate the mean (i.e. average daily return) of the last month of the stock's last 12 months. This would give you a \"standard deviation\" of 30 days (the number of days in the year).  So, in 10 years you should have 30*365 days/year, and in 1 year you would have 166 days/year.  The calculation is as follows: So if you have a stock that has had a 24% return (which it has done) over the last 12 years you can use the 166th day to estimate the return for the last 10 years.\n",

      " Answer:  I think the key is what is called 'equity compensation' or 'equity share'. It is the money paid in lieu of equity as dividends, interest or capital gain. If you are talking about the company, then it is a salary for the employee and is not tax deductible. The company may take this into account if the employee has other equity compensation.\n",

Yes, private clients can make deposits from their bank account at a bank that they have authorized as a business account.

      "How are dividends for shareholders of banks paid?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  Dividends are paid out when a company has declared financial results and is required to report the amount of dividend paid. Dividends are paid in addition to a company's profits. If a company makes profits, then the dividend amount is increased by the amount of profit. This is done for two reasons. One is to encourage people to keep money in the bank and increase the value of the company. Another reason is to increase profits so that it is possible to buy more shares. If the company fails to pay dividends, then it has to pay back the money it has borrowed, which is a very expensive process. This is a huge burden on the shareholders. It is also a huge tax issue. In some countries, dividends are taxed on the profits, in some countries on the amount of the dividend paid. It is also worth noting that the company can pay dividends to shareholders as well. It may be worthwhile doing this to attract shareholders to the company. If you want to know more about dividends and how they work, then you need to read up on the subject.\n",

Second, you have already built up the down payment and are well educated enough to understand the risks of buying a house. The cost of a house is going to be much lower than the cost of renting. If your parents are paying you rent for free, that is a huge benefit and should be encouraged by your parents. I'd say if you are paying rent to the landlord for free, you are being foolish.

The 20 year is a good rate if you can get it. You will still have to pay the taxes. If you are going to stay in Greece you should get a new mortgagorate before the April 2011 elections. If you move now you will have the same mortgage for 20 years. 15 year is more risky because you have to wait 10 years to get a new mortage.\n",

The best you can hope for is to be able to sell a stock to someone else who can actually afford to buy the stock.

You should never buy or sell an asset just based on that. There are many factors that determine the value of a stock. If you buy at $125 a share, you will have a market capitalization of $250M, meaning you would be worth $50M at $12.50 a share. So, you have $250k and the stock price is going up and down. But, the last trading volume is $250,000, so you are going up and down 250% in a very short period of time.\n",

It is simply due to the amount of stocks in the market and the price at which people are willing to buy or sell the stock. If people are willing to sell at that price, it is a market price change that will be reflected in the price change for the day. For the same reason as for any other type of price change, the day before and the day after the day when the price is changed are important. If a day is not available, then the day before or the day after is the best choice. The day of the week is less important.\n",

      " Answer:  You'll need to understand the terminology and understand that options trading is not the same as buying options, or other derivative investments. For instance, options are not just a contract to buy or sell the underlying asset, they are a contract to enter into the trading of the underlying asset. If you want to do something with options, then you need to understand how to do it, and understand what you are doing.\n",

      "Best way to pay off debt?\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  I just did this with a 26yr old student loan, and the money I put into it was the difference between my monthly expenses and the amount I was getting out of the loan. I used the money I put in to pay off the loan, and I am almost 26 years old. It took about 4 months. My student loan is paid off, and I have no debt other than my mortgage.  Here is what I did:  First, I paid off all of my high interest debt. The next one was the car. I put $2k a month into that, and it paid off. I put $10k a month into a new car. I put another $10k into a new car and got $12k off it. I put $8k a month into my house. I put $5k a month into savings. I put $3k a month into stocks.  My goal is to have no debt, and I am 26 years out of college. I am debt free, I have never missed a payment, and I have never missed paying interest.  I would highly recommend this plan\n",

      "Deduct Health Care Premiums for Family When Employer Only Pays for Me\n",
      "\n",
      " Answer:  There is no tax advantage in deducting health care premiums paid for family coverage under an employer-sponsored plan. There is no cost-sharing arrangement, which is another reason to discount the premium to the cost of your employer-sponored plan.  I would expect that if you are the primary beneficiary on a group policy that you will be entitled to deduct the premium paid for family coverage on Schedule A. If you are not the primary beneficiar, you will be entitled only to deduct the part of the premium paid by your employer for the family coverage on Schedules A and F. The difference between these two numbers is the amount of coverage you received. If your employer pays for your employer-paid group coverage with the same amount of coverage you are entitled to deduct, you are still entitled to deduct any premium paid for your family coverage.\n",

It is designed to meet the need of those retirees who are unable to invest on a daily basis.  In addition to the fact that the stock market and the bond market are very risky, the SIP also offers the ability to take advantage of low interest rate accounts to invest in the stock market, while still being able to do so in a low cost, high yield account.  It is the most common type of SIP, and it is the most popular type of SIP that people take advantage of.  However, SIP's are not the only types of investment plans.  There are many other types of investment planns, including many type of mutual funds, individual stocks, bonds, and REITS.\n",

I would not do anything except move into the house with the intention of renting it out to someone else in the future. It is a huge waste of money and a massive risk to have the house sit empty. You are paying a significant premium for a house you are not going to use. That's money you should be investing in the future. If you plan on renting it out and need to sell it to cover the expenses, that's what you will do. If you plan to sell, you need to decide if you will use it as a primary residence or a vacation property.  In the future, if you sell, you may not want to use the house as your primary residence anymore.  I would not invest the money in the future in something you would regret if you sold it.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  You can invest with a margin account in a variety of ways.  This is a type of bank account which is used for short-term investment purposes.  There are many types of short-term investments that can be made with a margin account.  The types of investments that you can make with a margin account include stocks, bonds, real estate investments, and other asset classes. The amount of money you borrow to invest in a margin account is limited to the amount you have deposited in your account.  It is also limited to your balance in your account. In general, the longer you hold a stock, the more interest you will receive.  If you hold stocks for less than a year, you will have a lower interest rate than if you hold them for more than a year.  If you borrow money from a bank, the interest rate you pay is determined by the bank.  For example, you might borrow $10,000 at 2% per year and pay $10 per year in interest.  If you are not sure that you will be able to pay back the money borrowed, you might borrow money from a broker.  This is another form\n",

      " Answer:  If you have a large enough amount of money, a company should be able to pay you a salary for the rest of your working life. That being said, it's hard to say.  Companies can also have profits that go to the owners and shareholders (which can be quite lucrative). If they do so, they are doing it for a reason - they want to be seen as a good corporate citizen and not a bad one. So there's a reason why they've always paid their workers. If you want to make a good living and invest in a company that makes you money, it is important to have the money to start with. It can take many years of work to start a company that you want to invest in.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  The account is assigned a non-margin position.  You may still be in the money for the account, but you may have to put in new margin if the account goes below 20% of the value on the previous trade.  If you're in a higher position, you may want to look into opening a margin account, which allows you to add margin to the account for a non-margin trade.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  Price history is based on supply and demand and is not the result of some algorithm. The price history is just a snapshot of the last time the price reached that price. Price history is only a snapshot of the previous price.  So what are you doing to the snapshot you're holding? If it's a chart with a price chart that's been for a few years, then you might have a better idea.  If it's not a chart, but rather some other data, then you're just speculating.  I wouldn't put my money on it, but you might want to see how many trades it took you to get to that price, so you know you're not crazy.\n",

      "\n",
      " Answer:  First, make sure you have enough money to pay the tuition fees for a semester at the top universities in your country. You will be studying at top universities for 4 years at the most. It is possible that you can get a job from the university in your country, but it will take you more time to get a job, especially if you don't have a degree. Second, look for employment in the university where you are studying. You could apply to work at the university for free, but be sure to find a job as soon as possible, as you will be leaving your country for at least 4 years and it is important to have a job. You will be able to get a job and will be eligible for the visa, but if you don' t find any job you will be stuck at university. Third, look for a job at a start-up. It is possible to get a job as a part-time employee of a startup. You will probably need to put in more time, but if you have the right skills and experience you will be eligable for the visa and you will get a job. Fourth, look for a part-time\n",

However, if you are not sure, the IRS may still prosecute you if you didn't file an audit/compliance/accounting report or didn't pay taxes.  I am a tax attorney, and the IRS will not prosecute you unless the IRS believes you have violated some other federal law, but I have never heard of anyone having to pay a penalty for a non-compliance.

      "\n",
      " Answer:  I think there are several things going on here: Greeting cards are not just for birthdays, Christmas, Easter, or any other holiday. They are used to advertise a business or product. If I want to go to a restaurant, or go to a concert, or to my friends' wedding, I use cards to remind me that I'm there. If I'm at work and my boss tells me to go to the store, I use a card to remind me of my meeting. And so on. Greeting cards are a part of the marketing for the product, and are a part of its value. The more expensive they are, the more people will buy them. If you want to buy a card, there are many online stores. If you want something with a high price point, you will likely have to drive to the store and wait in line.\n",

The stock split prices you have seen, and the prices at which the stock split are announced are generally based on the price of the last trade. The stock split prices are determined by what is known as the bid/ask spread. When there is a stock split, it is typically because of some large change in the price of the stock.  The new price is determined by the bid/ask.  The old price is generally the last price you can find.\n",

Long-term bond are risky for the following reasons: Long-term bond have more risk because the issuer is more vulnerable to bankruptcy. In the case of US Treasury, its debt is more vulnerable than the US treasury debt. Investors should be very careful about long-term bond and should not make investment with it.

      " Answer:  I am assuming that you are talking about the theater itself.  Theater theaters generally charge higher prices for popcorn, especially if it is a big movie or even if you are not going to see it.  Theater companies also tend to make money off of the ticket price.  They usually make a profit on the ticket price alone, but they also make money on the ticket price for selling merchandise (and sometimes a percentage of the ticket price).  I am guessing that they would also make a profit on ticket price alone.  So they tend to be more careful with the ticket price. The theater companies also tend not to discount the price for the price of popcorn, but that might be the other reason.\n",
