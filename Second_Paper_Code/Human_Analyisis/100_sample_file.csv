Question,Answer,Rating
Should I continue to invest in an S&P 500 index fund?,"I would argue that it makes sense to sell some of your holdings as you have seen the S&P 600 (the ""S&P 5.000"") drop a little this year. This is not because of the performance of the stocks, but because of the way that many companies are performing.  This could be a good time to sell your holdings.", 
"File bankruptcy, consolidate, or other options?","You are not a failure.  In fact, the bankruptcy system has a lot of benefits, including: If you are really struggling and feel that your finances are in crisis and you need a fresh start, I strongly suggest that you consult a professional, a licensed attorney, and a good financial advisor.  They are here to help you, and are willing to listen to you and to advise you.", 
How do you translate a per year salary into a part-time per hour job?,"You should take a look at the W4 form. If you don't know what you are doing, talk to an HR advisor. I was recently asked this question and it was answered by an HR adviser.", 
Quote driven and order driven financial markets,"I would not say that the quote driven markets are necessarily driven by the price of the underlying asset. I would say that the price of the stock is a factor, but that the price of any asset can be a factor as well.  The most recent price movement for a company is typically a good indicator of what is happening.  I've read a few articles about the price of oil and its relationship to the price of a company.", 
"If the U.S. defaults on its debt, what will happen to my bank money? ","I would expect that if they have defaulted, they are going to start charging more fees and possibly canceling your card.  The only other scenario you can expect is that you might have to close your credit card account.", 
What happens to people without any retirement savings?,"The bank will try to sell you a loan and they can. They're just trying to make a profit. You can request a loan from a bank or a credit union, they are a private business and they can't be trusted to make you whole.", 
How can a person with really bad credit history rent decent housing?,"The best advice I can offer is to make sure your credit is in order.  If you can, get a credit card with a 0% introductory rate.  That way you don't end up with a huge balance and being late on payments, or you get a chargeback on a card that you already used to purchase something. If you don't have a credit card, you can still get approved for a loan through your bank or a credit union.  If you're in a bad neighborhood, you might be able to get a loan through a credit union or a mortgage company.  I don't know about you, but I've never tried that. If you have a job, you can also try to make it a little easier on yourself.  If you don' t have a job, try to get a job.  I've found that working as a part-time security guard is enough to get you on your way to home ownership.  You'll have a job, and a place to stay, and a job to keep you from getting into trouble.", 
Who can truly afford luxury cars?,"I have been very fortunate to have had cars that cost less than $10k a year for 15 years, and have had them for 11 years.  The cost is not the luxury, it is the time commitment.  I can get a decent used luxury car for $35k (or $50k if it is a 4 year old) that can last me a decade.  Even with the extra $5k you could have a decent luxury car for a few years.", 
Should I invest or repay my debts?,"You can have both. You are young. There is no reason you should be investing. You are not getting any more money, and you have no debts to pay. If you don't have debts, you should just save, put your money into your retirement account, put the rest into the stock market, and invest.", 
TFSA over-contributions: How would the penalty apply in this scenario?,"I believe that your account should have been revised by the institution and your employer, and your TFSA is covered under the rules.  The TFSA will have a lower limit, since the account is now insured.", 
"For very high-net worth individuals, does it make sense to not have insurance?",The other answer mentions the insurance premium is just the tip of the iceberg. I'd like to add a few other factors to the mix:, 
Dividend yeild per unit,"I don't think dividends are really a significant factor.  The only thing I can think of is that companies can offer more dividend incentives when they issue stock.  For instance, I recently had my stock option vested and they offered me a dividend of $1.10 per share.  That's a nice dividend.  But it was still $1.15 less than the $2.50 that I got in my brokerage account.", 
Why might a robo-advisor service like Betterment be preferable to just buying a single well-performing index fund like SPY?,The one-size-fits-most approach.  I would argue that Betterment is just a market maker for the stocks they sell.  It does not really have the same level of service as buying individual stocks directly.  I don't know if Betterment is actually better than the S&P 500 index.  I've been using it for my 401k for a couple of years., 
How would I use Google Finance to find financial data about LinkedIn & its stock?,"I have a feeling that it's worth noting that the 10 year graph above is a direct copy of the 10-Q filing. The 10-K is the 10K, so there are lots of numbers there.", 
Difference between full and mini futures contract,"I think it's more a marketing strategy. The difference between futures and options is a matter of semantics. If I am not mistaken, the term ""futures contract"" has nothing to do with contracting the futures, it has to do with contracts. So if you are a trader you should always contract the futures contract. If you are an individual, you probably do not need to contract it.", 
"Can saving/investing 15% of your income starting age 25, likely make you a millionaire?",Yes. That's what Warren Buffet did in the late 1990s and 2000s. He was not alone. Investing 100% of your income for 15 years would earn you a millionaire., 
"If I'm cash-flow negative, should I dollar-cost-average the money from my bonus over the entire year?","Yes, you should dollar-cost average. You are saving money now, and you want to have it continue as you move through the next year. Dollar-cost averaging is a good idea when you are still young. If you don't have a retirement account that you can put money into, you can always have some of your money put in there.", 
What happens if a company I have stock in is bought out?,"I wouldn't be surprised if this happened, especially if it is one of the ""small cap"" stocks that can be bought and sold at a loss. The company's shares can be bought and/or sold at a loss (though the odds are very bad). If you have a large enough position you will probably get some type of notice, and the deal may be announced in the next few months.", 
How can a person with really bad credit history rent decent housing?,"I am not familiar with California, but I can tell you that the best solution is to get a loan from a credit union, with a low credit score. If you're eligible for the VA program and are in the 700-800 range, the VA will refinance your loan. This way you can get the same amount of money for the same term, and pay less interest.  The downside is that you'll be paying the higher interest rate. The VA will charge you $500-$1250 a month to help you with this.  There are also programs that are specifically geared towards helping people with bad credit histories, and these are usually only available if you are a veteran.", 
Why does capital gains tax apply to long term stock holdings?,"Short term capital gains are not taxed as ordinary income. However, there is a very specific case for the fact that a stock holder has to pay capital gains taxes. It's a very special case that can only be triggered in the event of a loss of value of the stock, which is a long term loss of value.", 
How to accurately calculate Apple's EPS,"If you look at the last earnings report of the company, and the same for Apple, you'll find that the Apple earnings report has a different number of $s/a. I would suggest using that report instead of the Apple earnings reports as this is the one that Apple has published. If you want to find out what's really going on, then you'll have to read the earnings report.  You can also do some googling, but it may not be as helpful.  If you look at the 2015 and 2016 reports, you'll see that the earnings report is the same, but the actual numbers for 2017 and 20

It is possible to determine this using the 2009 report, which shows a $2/a/a for Apple in 2013 and $2/a for Apple last year. The difference in numbers in 2008 and 2007 are also $2.70/a.", 
Any good software for value investment? ,Investopedia has some good advice on value investing: http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/04/investopedia_04.asp, 
Are there any credit cards with a statement period longer than 1 month?,Yes there are. I just got a new card that has the statement period of 28 days.  I don't remember what the rate was for the 3 month card.  I will be interested to see if I can get a better rate on that card., 
Do I pay a zero % loan before another to clear both loans faster?,It sounds like you are in a tight spot.  You are paying 3% and are on a fixed payment.  Your monthly payment will be about 30% less if you do not pay off the mortgage., 
Equation to determine if a stock is oversold and by how much?,"There is a method for looking at the stock's performance from an over-long perspective, which is to look at the stock price at the end of the trading day. It's called an Odd Lot and will give you a good idea of whether the stock is overselling. You will need to do some digging to see if it is indeed oversold, but it's a good indicator.  It's just a question of if you should buy or not.  Odd lot prices are quite common in the financial markets, and can be used for confirmation that a stock is o", 
Is it sensible to keep savings in a foreign currency?,"A very good question! As a person who has worked in international finance, I can say that there are a few good reasons to keep savings outside your home country.  The key one is to make sure that you do not run afoul of a foreign bank's anti-fraud regulations.  If you have a foreign account, you should make sure that you have an account number that is not already on file with the bank.  You will want to make sure that it is not an uncommon occurrence for you to have an account number for a bank that you don't want to be listed on your passport.  If you are not sure about a particular bank, I would not recommend keeping it there.", 
Using multiple bank accounts,Your bank account may be reported to credit agencies.  Your credit score will be affected.  In many cases you will not even get a report if you have multiple bank accounts., 
Sell or keep rental Property?,"The best advice I can give is to have a real estate attorney, and to keep in mind that you are still dealing with someone. If you are not willing to have a lawyer and your agent isn't willing to talk to you on the phone, the best advice I can offer you is to sell the property as you are currently and keep it as an investment until the property is sold.", 
Analyze stock value,The value of a stock can be calculated by the following:   For example:, 
What things are important to consider when investing in one's company stock?,"Invest in the company.  Invest in the company, but only if you want to stay invested long term.", 
"What should I do with my $10K windfall, given these options?","If you are going to take out a loan to pay off the debt, you will be paying a premium over the loan, and the bank is going to get their share of the profits. It is not uncommon for a bank to give a 0% interest rate if you take out a 0% loan.  You could pay off the debts, but if you don't pay off the debit card or car loan you will have to get an interest rate on a loan. If you don't mind the 0% rate you can always get a car loan for $30,000.  If you don'y mind the interest rate you can try a 0% rate for the next 12 months.  If you are willing to take the risk, I'd do that.", 
Where to find turnover / average amount of time investors & mutual funds held stocks they purchased?,"It depends on how you define a mutual fund, but it is pretty easy to figure out.  I've done the following: I've tried a few others, but they are all relatively painful.  Most mutual fund companies have some form of electronic records.  Some companies have some kind of database that you can upload your purchase history to.  That's what I did with Vanguard.  It has all the transactions, which is great.  But it's just one transaction per year.", 
What is the formula for determining estimated stock price when I  only have an earning per share number?,"I have a 10000 shares and 15000 earnings, so it is an estimate.  So the price will be $0.10 per share.  It doesn't matter how many shares there are.", 
How does giving to charity work?,"I would think that giving to charity is a gift.  Giving is an expression used by many people to mean giving, or ""making a donation"", but the gift can also be the result of charitable donations, or a gift of your own money.  Gifting to charities is one of the reasons why the IRS doesn't care if your donations are from stocks or bonds or whatever.  Gifting from a corporation to a non-profit is not considered a gift, because it is not a taxable gift to the corporation.", 
"If I pay taxes on my earnings, would someone also pay taxes on the same earnings if I subcontract them and pay a share?","I think you are missing the fact that in this situation the ""employee"" pays the taxes and in this case the ""subcontractor"" pays the tax.  The employer's share is the ""subcontractor"" and his share is the ""employee"". If your share of this company is $10,000,001, you'd pay $100,011 in taxes, not the employer's $10,500.  If the employer pays $5,000 and you pay $10,101, you will be the ""subcontributor"" and the employer will be ""employee"".  If the employment contract specifies that the subcontractor is not to be paid more than $10,999, the employer is supposed to pay the subcontractor more than $11,001. If you were to pay yourself the same amount of money, you would still be considered the ""subcontsubcontractor"" and not the ""subcontessor"" and the employment contract would say so.", 
At what age should I start or stop saving money?,"I was in a similar situation when I was younger.  I was in the same boat as you, saving for retirement was very important to me.  I started with a Roth IRA, then moved to a traditional IRA, and then I started contributing to a 401k.  I also did the traditional IRA, but I chose to have the Roth IRA be the sole investment for the time I was young.", 
How do I determine how much rent I could charge for a property or location?,"Ask the tenants.  It is not likely that the tenant will say no.  If you know this, you can just say ""no"" and walk away.  If they don't agree, you can try to negotiate with them.", 
Switch from DINK to SIWK: How do people afford kids?,"My husband is currently doing it, he works part time for a consultancy firm. They have two kids and they both have a wife. The wife has worked as a freelancer for a number of years. We have no debt and we have a £5000 a month income. He has been earning around £2000 a year for the last three years, we will be on track to have the money saved up before we have kids.", 
What does it mean that stocks are “memoryless”?,"What it really means is that you have to be careful to choose stocks that don't go down. You have to think of your goals for owning stocks, and then pick stocks that have achieved that goal, and not just stocks that are based on your opinion. If your investment portfolio is in one company and your goals are to invest in stocks, then you can buy stocks in that company, but you need to pick stocks that are performing well.", 
Capital gains on no-dividend stocks - a theoretical question,Capital gain distributions are not taxed at all. They are income., 
"If a mutual fund did really well last year, then statistically speaking, is it likely going to do bad this year?",Investopedia has some nice information on this subject: http://www.investopedia.com/finance/02/04/mutual-fund-dividend-history.asp, 
How do I figure out if I will owe taxes,"If you have any assets that have been accumulating, they will be treated as income. You will be taxed on any gain you make.", 
Is it possible to borrow money to invest in a foreign country?,"I'd not think that you can. You'd have to do a bit of homework, and if you have any experience of investing in foreign markets, you could probably do it.  But you would have to do that in the currency you want to invest in. If the currency is not the same as the one you're buying from, you might have trouble. Also, you should consider buying in a currency which is also considered stable by the bank.", 
A friend wants to use my account for a wire transfer. Is this a scam or is it legitimate?,"I'm not a lawyer, but in the US, wire transfer fees are common, and you could try calling the bank.  You can ask for proof of your account number and account number.  If you call the bank, they will tell you if the account is active or not.", 
How to make a decision for used vs new car if I want to keep the car long term?,"There are a couple of factors you should consider when choosing a car. You need to figure out what you are trying to achieve with the car and what is important to you. If you are trying to get a better deal than the dealership is offering, then you might not have to do the deal. You could negotiate with the dealer.  If you are looking for a car that is still new but you are trying to keep the value of the car for 10-15 years, you could try to find a car that is under 3 years old.  You would be better off paying a little more for a new car that has a little more value and you can keep it for 10 years or more.", 
Selling put and call Loss Scenario Examples,"It seems you have to wait until expiration to sell a call, as you cannot sell a call before expiration.", 
"Child is on the way, invest for college and car fund options - opinions","There are a lot of factors here. First, congrats on the impending parenthood! I wish you both the best, and good luck with your future family. The investments should be focused on long-term. Your 2010-2015 plan should be a mix of bonds, CD's, and stocks.  Investing should be a hobby, not an expense.  This will help you feel more financially prepared when it comes time to start saving for college and/or a car.", 
super confused about bid and ask size. help,"There is a difference between the ask and bid size. The bid size is the lowest price that you can place an order for at a given stock. The ask size is the highest price that you can pay at a given stock at any time. It's the highest price that a stock can be placed at, and it is the lowest price a stock can be paid at.", 
Relation between inflation rates and interest rates,There are a few things to keep in mind:, 
In what cases can a business refuse to take cash?,"The only situation that I have seen of this happening is in cases where a business is being sued for fraud. If you go to the bank and demand that they pay you in a certain amount, they'll take it. But you'll have to show up at the bank and show them a letter saying ""Please pay me in this amount"".", 
Where should I park my money if I'm pessimistic about the economy and I think there will be high inflation?,"First, you should never invest in an index fund. Invest in low-cost funds. Second, you should not invest in individual stocks. You should invest in an index. You should invest your money in stocks with diversified risk-adjusted returns.  In the stock market, there are a few ""safe"" securities. There are a few ""high-risk"" securities, too. There are also a few ""safe-return"" securities that will not pay dividends. You can try to diversify these investments if you want to try to get more diversified returns.", 
How do I find a good mutual fund to invest 5K in with a moderately high amount of risk?,"If you want to be diversified, look for a fund that can diversify your portfolio, i.e. invest in different asset classes in different countries. This is a great idea if you want to invest in different asset class, and it would be better if you invest in the same country, as it will be easy to compare the performance of each country. The key point is to diversify your investments, so if one country or region is doing poorly, you should diversify to another one or region that is doing better.", 
Are warehouse clubs like Costco and Sam's Club worth it?,I just got a membership from Sam's club.  I've heard great things about it.  I would be careful about the prices.  They can get you 1/2 price or more when you sign up.  I would not buy a membership.  You can sign up for the free Sam's club email newsletter and get their prices at a discount., 
Isn't an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) a surefire way to make tons of money?,"It's just an investment. If someone comes along who knows how to build a company and is willing to invest, you could make money. If you're in the ""no"" camp, then I would suggest the ICO as a way to build a product that can be sold on a regular basis.", 
How can I save money on a gym / fitness membership? New Year's Resolution is to get in shape - but on the cheap!,"First of all, if you want to get into shape and stay in shape, you need to find a way to motivate yourself to do it. If you have been avoiding exercising because you don't have enough money for it, I think that's a good start. If you don't mind a little exercise every once in a while, then you could try the free online programs like yoga, which I like a lot, but I think they are just too expensive for most people. For most people, it is worthwhile to get into shape to improve your health and reduce your risk of developing chronic diseases like heart disease and cancer.", 
How does remittance work? How does it differ from direct money transfer?,You need to send the money using Remittance to your bank account. Your bank account can only be used for remittance purposes. The Remittance is the funds which you have remitted to the sender. You can make use of this money and transfer it to the bank account., 
Is it worth it to reconcile my checking/savings accounts every month?,"Yes, it is a worthwhile endeavor.", 
Should I open a credit card when I turn 18 just to start a credit score?,"If you're going to use the card as a means of funding a car or home purchase, you'll want to pay off the card in full before you get a loan or refinance. If you're going on to apply for credit cards and other loans in the future, and you're going from 0 to 18 without much of a downpayment, the only thing you'll want is to make sure that you don't overdraw the card. If you do overdraw it, you'll have to pay interest. 18 is the perfect age to start a credit card because you'll get the most rewards.", 
what if a former employer contributes to my 401k in the year following my exit?,"I think the best answer is ""No.""  The 401K plan doesn't need to match your retirement savings, you can invest in a low-cost index fund for retirement.  It can also have your money automatically deducted from it.  You'll get tax benefits from this, and the funds are tax free.", 
Why should I trust investment banks' ratings?,"I think the question is very important to ask. The rating agencies make a profit by doing so, and if they are doing it for their clients, I think that's a very high price to pay for that kind of information.  I personally believe that a good, solid investment bank would have very high ratings, so I think it's worth the investment to have them.", 
Is this investment opportunity problematic?,"The problem is that you are asking how to invest. It's simple.  If you have 200,000 in cash and need to invest $20,001, you'd have to find investors willing to take on the risk of investing $20, 000. So you will need 20,010 people willing to invest $2,001. The market is already crowded, so your chances are even worse.", 
SBI term deposit versus SBI bonds,"The bonds have a very short term view. It's basically like a bond. So, a bond has a short term view and if you have to buy it in the future, it's a good deal.", 
Can't the account information on my checks be easily used for fraud?,"You should check your account statements with your bank or credit card issuer. You'll need to verify that they are accurate. If they aren't, contact your bank or credit union.", 
Are COBRA premiums deductible when self-employed?,"I don't know what the rules are in your state, but the CobbDad and Dad are self-employement. They both work as consultants for companies, and are on the payroll of the companies. If they are self-employment, they would deduct all the expenses, including the COBRA premium. The CobbDad is self-employing as well, and would deduct all expenses as well.", 
"How much total salary to allocate to defer $17,500 to 401(k)?","I agree with @RockyTaxpayer and the other answers that it is best to just set aside the $17,000 and put the rest in a 401k plan. The $17,250 in taxes is a nice chunk of change that you would otherwise put in an IRA, and the rest of the 15k you are contributing is a nice chunk too.", 
Pay index fund expense ratios with cash instead of fund balance,Yes. There are expense ratiors that do not apply to stocks., 
Do Fundamentals Matter Anymore in Stock Markets? ,"No, I don't think fundamentals are any more relevant nowadays. There is much more to investment than fundamental analysis.", 
Strategy for investing large amount of cash,"It is a good strategy to invest in stocks because they are cheap, have low volatility and don't lose value very easily.  The only risk you might face is if the company goes bankrupt or if you lose a significant portion of your investment.  For this reason you should avoid equities because they have low returns and are not very diversified.", 
Is it a good idea to put everything in the S&P500?,"The S&P520 has a good percentage of US stocks (41%) that are held by US citizens. You are still a good idea to buy US stocks in general, and US equities in particular.", 
Estate taxes and the top 1 percent by net worth,"This isn't a question that has been asked or answered before.  I've tried to answer it but the answer to my own question is ""Yes"". I don't believe that any estate tax would be levied on anyone that makes less than $250k. I have done some research on the subject and have found that estate tax is levied on the top 1% of the estate.  I also found that this tax has not been levied on people making less than $1M.  So I don't think it is levied on anyone. I hope this helps.", 
Questions about government bonds that have already matured,"I think the question you are looking for is: ""What are the best/worst bonds that I can buy in the future"". The answer to this question depends a lot on your risk tolerance. If you are looking for a bond that you can buy in the next few years, and you are not worried about the issuer defaulting, you should look at the following bonds: This should help you to decide which issuer to buy the bond from. You should also look at the bond price, since this will help you determine if the issuer has made good on its promises. The last two bonds I've mentioned should help you decide which issuer you should buy the bond from, as well.", 
Should I wait a few days to sell ESPP Stock?,"I wouldn't wait. It is likely that the ESPP is in the 10% range, so it will probably be worth selling. If the ESPP is higher, it is likely to be worth selling at a higher price.", 
How will the fall of the UK Pound impact purchasing my first property?,"In the past, this was a common thing to do. But with the Brexit vote, you will be a lot more vulnerable to this. In the US, this is more true for first time home buyers.", 
Best way for for soon to turn 18 to learn about money?,"If you're looking for something that will give you some direction on where you want to be financially, it's important to do it on your own.  You need to learn how to be a good citizen with a good work ethic.  It will make your life easier and less stressful in the long run.", 
"Is it better to buy a computer on my credit card, or on credit from the computer store?","I would not recommend the computer store as a long term investment.  I've seen some of the other answers here suggest that they can be a good long term investment for the right person.  The reality is, though, that they have a long term problem: they're going to have to pay for the computer for the next 10 years or more.  And in the meantime, they're going out of business.  If you buy a computer for a month, and then have to pay for it for 10 years, you can expect to be out of business in a few years. I would not recommend the credit card as a long term, high risk investment.  It will take a long time for you to pay for it.  If you can't afford it, you'll be in trouble.  And if you're going to be in trouble, the store is going to be in a lot of trouble.", 
Multiple hard inquiry for a single loan from car dealer?,"If you want a different bank, call them and tell them that you want to close the loan early.  That way you can avoid closing the loan and you won't be impacted.  They should be able to tell you why the loan was not closed, and they can close it in a timely manner.", 
How do I figure out the next step in deciding to sell my home to the market or to a uniquely interested buyer?,"First of all, you need to know the exact numbers. If you are not sure, you should consult a professional, because this is very important. The real estate agent will be able to give you an exact figure. If you have not sold yet, that's great! If you've already bought the house, congratulations! You have a huge advantage, because you already have a lot of knowledge about the house and the market. You can use the same tools you would have used in the past: The trick is to find the right buyer. That is the hardest part.", 
Where to find historical quotes for the Dow Jones Global Total Stock Market Index?,"The Dow Jones Total Stock Market Index Quote is listed on the Dow Jones website, along with the other historical data feeds.", 
Is there a country that uses the term “dollar” for currency without also using “cents” as fractional monetary units?,"It's called the Dollar-era, and is one of the oldest currencies in the world. In fact, it was invented by the Bank of England, who used it as the basis for the London Pound (later called the Pound Sterling). It was used by countries like Japan and the UK from the 1870s onward. However, it is also used in some emerging markets like Hong Kong, and by governments that are using currencies like the Thai baht.", 
Shares in Chinese startup company,"Their shares are in Chinese. There is a Chinese company called Dongguan Tech, which is headquartered in Shenzhen, China. They are a startup and there are no shares held by them. If they want to be publicly traded on China stock market, you should buy the shares on China stock market. They are not publicly traded in Shanghai.", 
Where should I invest my savings?,You might want to consider the following:, 
Can't the account information on my checks be easily used for fraud?,I just looked at this link: https://www.check-freeze.com/faqs/faq-109.html#what-happens-if-i-have-not-paid-my-bills-with-the-check-i-received, 
Why do I get a much better price for options with a limit order than the ask price?,"I know there's a ""risk premium"" to be had by doing this, but I'm not sure that's the case in this case.  The ask price of 1.10 is probably closer to the ask price of 0.10 (which is a reasonable price to ask) than the bid price of 11000.  I'm not entirely sure if this is a ""risk"" premium, though; the bid price is probably not too far above the ask price, but if you have a high enough ask bid price, you may get a better deal.", 
Advantages/disadvantages of buying stocks on dips vs buying outright?,"I have seen several people suggest that selling off shares of stock to reduce risk. This is a very simple way to reduce risk, but it is also a very complicated way to reduce risk. I have been a little hesitant to do it because it makes it more complicated to manage. I would say that the key is the ability to manage risk. If I buy shares of stock and it goes up I don't need to worry about it. But I would say that I have been lucky in that I have never had a stock go down. I have had the stock drop 30% but not once. I would be happy if I could have done this 200 times.", 
Is sales tax for online purchases based on billing- or shipping address?,"The fact is that tax authorities consider the shipping address the same as the customer's physical address, regardless of the method of shipping.

The IRS doesn't seem to like it.",

What is the psychology behind the Dead Cat Bounce Pattern and how can it be traded?,"It's an unpredictable market, and the psychology behind it is the same as anything else.

How does a online only bank protect itself against fraud? ,The safest way is for the bank to have the right to check the records of your account. The safest way is to make sure that there is no transaction which has not been reported to the bank and to report that to the police and to the relevant authorities. It would also be very good to have records of your purchases and of the bank's actions.,

Why do stocks priced above $2.00 on the ASX sometimes move in $0.005 increments?,"I think you are missing something, but I can't find a way to get a good answer. I have been able to trade this stock, but not at a consistent enough rate to make it worth it. My guess is that the price is not just the price of the last trade but also a percentage of what I am looking at.",

Why do people buy insurance even if they have the means to overcome the loss?,"One of the most significant reasons is that the insurance company is hoping to sell the insurance.  If they were to lose you and they could get back your money, they might do that.  They might do this by increasing premiums.  They might offer a policy for less money.  They might sell a policy with a higher deductible.  They might even offer an optional add-on to cover you for something you never asked for.", 
Why does it take two weeks (from ex-date) for dividends to pay out?,"I'm sure there are plenty of other answers to this question, but I believe there's a simple explanation: The ex-date is just a day on the calendar (as the company has to pay taxes and make a filing on that date). So if a company is paying out dividends every two weeks, they need to make sure that their investors get their payments on the second week.", 
Buying insurance (extended warranty or guarantee) on everyday goods / appliances?,"You are making assumptions that the product you bought is ""uncommon"", so you should expect that there is a small chance of it breaking. The manufacturer is also unlikely to do a recall, as you are buying a new model and you are expecting the new model to last longer than the previous one. I would suggest to go with the product you bought.",
