How to safely earn interest on business profits (UK) ,"As @Chris_Penn pointed out, you should not do business with anyone you do not trust. You will lose your money and may end up getting sued for something like fraud and damages, and you may end up being held liable for money you are not actually responsible for. So if you have business and want to make money from it, I would recommend doing it through an account at an online brokerage. There are some brokers out there that will give you a fraction of their fees and a small amount of money for each transaction. If you have a business and you want to be paid in a timely manner, you should probably talk to your accountant and lawyer about how to do it.", 
What is the Difference between Life Insurance and ULIP?,"Insurance companies make money when you purchase a policy, and when you sell it. Life insurance companies make money when a family member decides to make a large purchase of a policy, and sells the policy to you. In both cases, you are protected from the cost of the insurance, and the insurance company will make money from the sale of the insurance.  If I was you, I would do my own research and make sure that the company is providing a policy that you can afford and would be able to keep up with the life expectancy of the policy.", 
Living in my own rental property,"You may want to hire an accountant or CPA to do the calculations.  I did this when I bought my rental.  It turned out to be a good thing.  The accountant told me I'd have a good understanding of my financial position, my income, and my expenses.  He also told me to take my time with the calculations and keep my expenses low.  I found the expenses to be a good idea.  I found that I did not need a CPA or accountant to do this.  He was right about the expenses.",

"Is this mortgage advice good, or is it hooey?","This is a good question to ask yourself: ""Am I better off with a 30 year fixed or 15 year fixed mortgage?""  The short answer is yes.  15 year mortgages are generally much better than 30 year mortgages.  The reason is that the 30 year is typically only 1/2 the amount that can be paid down.  The reason that 15 year mortages are often only 1/4 the amount is that the interest rate on 30 year loans is typically 1.5% or higher.", 
Short Term Capital Gains tax vs. IRA Withdrawal Tax w/o Quarterly Est. Taxes,"In the end you are still taxed on your income, just not on the capital gain. It's still subject to the quarterly tax. You should talk to an accountant to see what would be the best solution for you.", 
Where do expense ratios show up on my statement?,"The expense ratio is calculated as the ratio of the company's stock price to the company's net profits. If you buy shares of the company at $10 per share, and the company has a $10000 net profit, the expense ratio would be $100. The company would pay the $100 as expense, and the net profit would be $9000.", 
Is Cost of Living overstated?,"In the end the question is akin to this one, but there are a couple of important points to keep in mind: In the US, the median household income is around $140K, which is more than the median in some countries. It's not a terrible number, but it's not the sort of number that people would find useful for a living expense calculation.  That being said, it is a pretty good number for most people. It's also pretty easy to find, even though the question has no reference. It's a good number for most things. It's just a bad number for most things, even though it's not really a bad number.",

Why doesn't Japan just divide the Yen by 100? ,"I know it would be easier to just say ""100"" in Japanese, but the Yen is a divisor. The 100 yen in the US is just a symbol. The Yen in Japan is actually a symbol.",
