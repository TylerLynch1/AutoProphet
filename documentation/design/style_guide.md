## Introduction  
This design guide defines the visual and interaction standards for the application to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience. It provides guidelines for UI components, typography, colors, and layout to maintain coherence across the app.  

## Design Principles  
The app design follows these core principles:  
- Simplicity & Clarity – The interface should be easy to understand and navigate. Keep it simple and minimalistic.
- Consistency – Design patterns and UI components should be uniform throughout the app.  Icons that appear throughout all pages should be appearing in the same part of the screen. 
- Responsiveness – The UI should adapt seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.  


## Color Palette  
Define the primary, secondary, and neutral colors used in the app:  

| Name       | Hex Code  | Usage                      |  
|------------|----------|---------------------------|  
| Primary    | #2B388F  | Callout boxes,     |  
| Secondary  | #27A2CC  | Secondary actions, labels  |  
| Background | #FFFFFF  | App background             |  
| Text       | Bright mode: #000000 Dark mode: #FFFFFF| Main text color |  
    
## Typography  
Specify the fonts, sizes, and styles used:  

- Primary Font:  Segoe UI, Oxygen  
  
- Body Text: 20px, regular  
- Small Text: 17px, regular
